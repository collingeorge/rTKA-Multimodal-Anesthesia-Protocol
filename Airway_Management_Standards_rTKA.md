**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14  
**Clinical Validation:** Aligned with ASA Practice Guidelines for Management of the Difficult Airway and institutional best practices

---

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive airway management standards for patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) under general anesthesia. Standards apply across all three anesthetic pathways (OFIA + Blocks, OFIA Block-Free, Opioid-Inclusive) and cover the entire perioperative period from preinduction assessment through postoperative care.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - Airway management must be adapted to individual patient anatomy and clinical circumstances
> - **ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm serves as the foundation for emergency airway management**
> - Clinical judgment guides appropriate airway management techniques in all situations
> - Institutional protocols and provider credentialing requirements supersede general recommendations

**Scope of application:**
- Adult patients undergoing elective rTKA under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation
- Covers preoperative airway assessment, induction airway management, intraoperative ventilation, emergence extubation, and postoperative respiratory care
- Emergency airway scenarios and complications
- References Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK), Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free), Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive)

**Regulatory alignment:**
- ASA Practice Guidelines for Management of the Difficult Airway (most recent edition)
- ASA Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring (ventilation and oxygenation components)
- Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals
- Emergency airway management per Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS)

**Key principles:**
- **Preoxygenation before every induction**
- **Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation**
- **Always have a backup plan for airway management**
- **Recognize difficult airway early and escalate appropriately**
- **Ensure complete neuromuscular recovery before extubation**
- **Maintain airway safety through emergence and postoperative period**

## 1. Preoperative Airway Assessment

### 1.1 Components of Airway Evaluation

**Every patient must receive a focused airway examination before anesthesia**

**Structured airway assessment (LEMON or equivalent):**

**L - Look externally:**
- Facial trauma, burns, or previous surgery
- Beard or facial hair (may interfere with mask seal)
- Body habitus (obesity, short neck, large breasts)
- Dysmorphic features suggesting difficult airway
- Obvious anatomic abnormalities

**E - Evaluate 3-3-2 rule:**

| Measurement | Assessment | Normal Finding | Concerning Finding |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Mouth opening (3)** | Distance between upper and lower incisors when mouth fully open | ≥3 finger breadths (~4-5 cm) | <3 finger breadths suggests limited access |
| **Hyomental distance (3)** | Distance from hyoid bone to chin with neck extended | ≥3 finger breadths | <3 finger breadths suggests anterior larynx |
| **Thyromental distance (2)** | Distance from thyroid notch to chin with neck extended | ≥2 finger breadths (~6.5 cm) | <2 finger breadths suggests difficult visualization |

**M - Mallampati score:**

| Class | Visualization | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Class I** | Soft palate, fauces, uvula, anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars visible | Easy intubation likely |
| **Class II** | Soft palate, fauces, uvula visible | Generally favorable |
| **Class III** | Soft palate, base of uvula visible | More difficult intubation possible |
| **Class IV** | Only hard palate visible | Difficult intubation likely |

**Technique:** Patient sitting upright, mouth fully open, tongue protruded maximally without phonation

**O - Obstruction:**
- Any condition causing upper airway obstruction
- Stridor, voice changes, difficulty breathing when supine
- Epiglottitis, abscess, tumor, angioedema
- OSA severity (see Section 10.1)

**N - Neck mobility:**
- Full range of motion (flexion/extension)
- Atlanto-occipital extension critical for laryngoscopy
- Limited by cervical spine disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, prior fusion
- Assess: "Touch your chin to your chest" (flexion); "Look at the ceiling" (extension)

**Additional airway assessment elements:**

**Dentition:**
- Loose, chipped, or capped teeth (risk of dental injury)
- Prominent upper incisors (may obstruct laryngoscopy view)
- Edentulous (may improve laryngoscopy but worsen mask ventilation)
- Dental appliances (dentures, bridges - must be removed)

**Previous anesthetic history:**
- Prior difficult intubation or mask ventilation
- Previous anesthetic records (review if available)
- Patient or family report of airway difficulties

**Body mass index (BMI):**
- BMI >35 increases difficulty of mask ventilation and intubation
- Obesity associated with reduced functional residual capacity and rapid desaturation

**Specialized predictors:**

**STOP-Bang score for OSA (see Section 10.1):**
- Relevant because OSA patients often have difficult airways
- Score ≥3 suggests high OSA risk

**El-Ganzouri Risk Index (multivariate):**
- Combines: mouth opening, Mallampati, neck mobility, thyromental distance, body weight, history
- Score ≥4 predicts difficult intubation

### 1.2 Difficult Airway Prediction

**Definition of difficult airway:**
- Difficult mask ventilation: Inability to maintain SpO₂ >90% using mask with 100% oxygen and positive pressure
- Difficult laryngoscopy: Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4
- Difficult intubation: Requires >2 attempts or >10 minutes
- Failed intubation: Unable to intubate after multiple attempts

**Risk factors for difficult mask ventilation (MOANS):**

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **M - Mask seal** | Beard, edentulous, facial trauma/surgery/radiation |
| **O - Obesity/Obstruction** | BMI >30, OSA, airway masses, epiglottitis |
| **A - Age** | >55 years associated with increased difficulty |
| **N - No teeth** | Edentulous makes mask seal difficult |
| **S - Stiff lungs/chest** | COPD, asthma, chest wall deformity, pregnancy |

**Presence of ≥2 MOANS factors significantly increases difficult mask ventilation risk**

**Risk factors for difficult intubation:**
- Mallampati III or IV
- Thyromental distance <6 cm
- Mouth opening <4 cm
- Limited neck extension
- Obesity (BMI >35)
- Previous difficult intubation
- Cervical spine immobility
- Facial trauma or anomalies
- Large tongue (macroglossia)
- High arched palate
- Receding mandible (micrognathia, retrognathia)

**Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate (CICO) risk factors:**
- Combination of difficult mask ventilation AND difficult intubation predictors
- This is the most feared airway emergency
- Requires immediate recognition and emergency airway algorithm

### 1.3 Airway Assessment Documentation

**Mandatory preoperative airway documentation:**

**History:**
- Previous anesthetics and any documented airway difficulties
- OSA diagnosis and severity (AHI, CPAP use)
- Snoring, witnessed apneas
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (aspiration risk)
- Recent upper respiratory infection (increased airway reactivity)
- Smoking history (airway reactivity, secretions)

**Physical examination:**
- Mallampati classification
- Mouth opening (cm or finger breadths)
- Thyromental distance (cm or finger breadths)
- Neck range of motion (full, limited, or restricted)
- Dentition (normal, prominent incisors, loose teeth, edentulous)
- Body habitus (BMI documented)
- Presence of beard

**Risk stratification:**
- Predicted difficult mask ventilation: Yes/No
- Predicted difficult intubation: Yes/No
- Predicted difficult airway: Yes/No (either or both of above)

**Airway management plan:**
- Standard induction vs awake fiberoptic intubation
- Primary airway technique planned
- Backup plan if primary fails
- Equipment needs (video laryngoscope, fiberoptic scope, etc.)
- Need for additional personnel

**Example documentation:**
"Airway exam: Mallampati II, mouth opening 4 cm, thyromental distance 7 cm, full neck ROM, normal dentition, BMI 28. No prior anesthetic difficulties. Predicted normal mask ventilation and intubation. Plan: Standard RSI with video laryngoscopy available."

## 2. Preinduction Preparation and Preoxygenation

### 2.1 Preinduction Setup

**Patient positioning for induction:**

**"Sniffing position" (optimal for laryngoscopy):**
- Head elevated 8-10 cm on firm pillow or folded blankets
- Atlanto-occipital joint extended (as if "sniffing morning air")
- External auditory meatus aligned with sternal notch (horizontal alignment)
- **In obese patients:** "Ramped position" - shoulder and head elevation to achieve ear-sternal notch alignment

**Positioning checklist:**
- Patient supine on OR table
- Head of bed can be raised/lowered as needed
- Arms tucked or on arm boards (ensure no pressure points)
- Safety strap across thighs
- Adequate IV access confirmed and secured
- All monitoring in place and functioning

**Final checks before induction:**

- [ ] Patient identity and procedure verified (timeout complete)
- [ ] Anesthesia machine checkout complete
- [ ] Oxygen source connected and confirmed
- [ ] Suction functioning at bedside (Yankauer tip ready)
- [ ] Monitors applied (ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP)
- [ ] IV access patent with free-flowing crystalloid
- [ ] Airway equipment ready (see Section 3)
- [ ] Emergency medications drawn (phenylephrine, ephedrine, atropine/glycopyrrolate)
- [ ] Difficult airway equipment immediately available if predicted difficult airway
- [ ] Trained assistant present and ready
- [ ] Team ready to proceed (anesthesia, surgery, nursing)

### 2.2 Preoxygenation Techniques

**Goal of preoxygenation:**
- Replace nitrogen in functional residual capacity (FRC) with oxygen
- Create oxygen reservoir to prolong safe apnea time
- Achieve end-tidal oxygen concentration (EtO₂) >90% (ideally >95%)

**Target:** 3-5 minutes of tidal volume breathing of 100% oxygen OR 8 maximal vital capacity breaths in 60 seconds

**Standard preoxygenation technique:**

**Equipment:**
- Well-fitting face mask
- Anesthesia circuit with 100% oxygen
- Fresh gas flow 10 L/min minimum

**Patient instructions:**
- "Breathe normally through this mask for 3-5 minutes"
- Ensure tight mask seal (two-handed technique if needed)
- Monitor for adequate tidal volumes and mask seal

**Monitoring effectiveness:**
- EtO₂ displayed on monitor (goal >90%)
- Oxygen saturation stable at 100%
- Visible chest rise with each breath
- No leak around mask (hear/feel no hissing)

**Enhanced preoxygenation for high-risk patients:**

**Obese patients (BMI >30):**
- **Head-up position:** 25-30 degrees (improves FRC, delays desaturation)
- **Extended preoxygenation:** 5 minutes minimum
- **Positive pressure:** CPAP 5-10 cmH₂O during preoxygenation (further increases oxygen reservoir)
- Consider apneic oxygenation (see below)

**OSA patients:**
- Head-up positioning
- CPAP during preoxygenation if tolerated
- Extended preoxygenation time

**Pregnant patients:**
- Head-up 15-30 degrees (left uterine displacement if late pregnancy)
- Rapid desaturation expected (increased metabolic demand, decreased FRC)
- Vigilant preoxygenation critical

**COPD/respiratory disease:**
- May not achieve SpO₂ 100% (acceptable if at patient baseline)
- Extended preoxygenation time
- Avoid excessive positive pressure (risk of barotrauma if severe bullous disease)

**Apneic oxygenation:**

**Concept:** Provide oxygen flow during apneic period (after induction, during laryngoscopy)

**Technique:**
- Nasal cannula at 5-15 L/min placed before induction
- Leave in place during laryngoscopy
- Provides continuous oxygen delivery to pharynx
- Prolongs safe apnea time, especially in obese patients

**Evidence:** May extend safe apnea time by 1-2 minutes in obese patients

**Preoxygenation failure (unable to achieve adequate preoxygenation):**
- Patient unable to cooperate or tolerate mask
- Significant mask leak
- Airway obstruction preventing effective ventilation
- **Consider:** Awake intubation techniques or modified induction strategy

### 2.3 Aspiration Risk Assessment

**Aspiration pneumonitis: Chemical injury from gastric contents (pH <2.5, volume >25 mL)**

**Risk factors for aspiration:**

**Patient factors:**
- Inadequate NPO status (recent oral intake)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Gastroparesis (diabetes, opioids)
- Bowel obstruction
- Pregnancy (delayed gastric emptying)
- Obesity
- Difficult airway (prolonged attempts increase risk)

**Procedural factors:**
- Emergency surgery (inadequate NPO time)
- Difficult mask ventilation (gastric insufflation increases risk)
- Inadequate depth of anesthesia during intubation (coughing, straining)

**NPO guidelines (ASA):**

| Ingested Material | Minimum Fasting Period |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Clear liquids | 2 hours |
| Breast milk | 4 hours |
| Infant formula | 6 hours |
| Light meal | 6 hours |
| Full meal (fatty/fried foods) | 8 hours |

**For elective rTKA:** Patients typically NPO after midnight (8+ hours for solids, clear liquids until 2 hours before)

**Aspiration risk mitigation strategies:**

**Pharmacologic prophylaxis (for high-risk patients):**
- **Sodium citrate 30 mL PO** (non-particulate antacid; neutralizes gastric pH immediately)
- **H2-blocker:** Famotidine 20 mg IV (reduces acid production; give 60 min pre-op)
- **Proton pump inhibitor:** Pantoprazole 40 mg PO/IV evening before and morning of surgery
- **Metoclopramide 10 mg IV** (promotes gastric emptying; give 30-60 min pre-op)
  - Contraindications: Bowel obstruction, Parkinson disease, prolonged QT

**Rapid sequence induction (RSI) when indicated:**
- See Section 4.3 for technique
- Used when aspiration risk high and adequate NPO status uncertain

**Elective rTKA note:**
- Most patients are low aspiration risk (adequate NPO, elective procedure)
- Routine aspiration prophylaxis typically NOT indicated for standard rTKA
- Consider in obese patients, GERD, diabetics with gastroparesis

### 3.2 Video Laryngoscopy

**Video laryngoscopy (VL) becoming standard of care for many institutions**

**Advantages over direct laryngoscopy (DL):**
- Improved glottic visualization (better Cormack-Lehane grade)
- Reduced force on upper airway structures (less trauma)
- Teaching tool (others can see laryngoscopic view)
- Helpful in anticipated or unanticipated difficult airway
- May reduce complications

**Common video laryngoscope systems:**
- **GlideScope** (curved blade with camera)
- **McGrath** (portable, disposable blade options)
- **C-MAC** (Macintosh-style blade with video capability)
- **King Vision** (disposable channeled blade)

**Video laryngoscopy technique differences from DL:**
- **Look at the screen, not the patient**
- May require more acute angulated stylet for ETT delivery
- Avoid excessive lifting force (better view doesn't require as much force)
- ETT advancement requires coordination between screen view and tube manipulation

**Institution-specific:**
- Some institutions use VL as first-line for all intubations
- Others reserve for predicted/encountered difficult airways
- Provider should be credentialed and experienced with available VL technology

**Availability for rTKA:**
- Video laryngoscope should be immediately available (in room or immediately outside)
- If predicted difficult airway, have VL ready before induction

### 3.3 Difficult Airway Cart/Equipment

## 4. Standard Airway Management - Induction and Intubation

### 4.1 Standard Induction Sequence

**Timeline and steps for routine induction and intubation:**

**Pre-induction (T-5 to T-0 minutes):**
- Final safety checks complete
- Preoxygenation initiated (3-5 minutes of 100% FiO₂)
- Monitoring confirmed (SpO₂, ECG, NIBP baseline obtained)
- Team briefed on plan

**Induction (T-0):**
- Induction agents administered per protocol (see Protocol Comparison Table)
  - Propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg IV (reduce in elderly/frail/cardiac)
  - +/- Ketamine 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV (OFIA adjunct, optional)
  - +/- Fentanyl 50-100 mcg IV (Protocol 3 only)
- Patient loses consciousness (typically 30-45 seconds)

**Apneic phase (T+30 seconds to T+90 seconds):**
- Confirm loss of consciousness (no response to verbal stimuli, loss of eyelash reflex)
- Neuromuscular blocking drug administered:
  - Rocuronium 0.6-1.0 mg/kg IV
- **AVOID positive pressure ventilation until adequate relaxation** (prevents gastric insufflation in most cases)
- **Exception:** If SpO₂ declining, provide gentle mask ventilation

**Mask ventilation assessment (T+90 seconds to T+3 minutes):**
- After adequate time for muscle relaxant onset (typically 90-120 seconds for rocuronium)
- Assess ease of mask ventilation:
  - Apply face mask with two-handed technique if needed
  - Jaw thrust to open airway
  - Gentle positive pressure ventilation
  - Observe chest rise and EtCO₂ waveform
  - **Confirm adequate mask ventilation before proceeding to laryngoscopy**

**If mask ventilation adequate:**
- Proceed to laryngoscopy

**If mask ventilation difficult:**
- Optimize technique (see Section 4.2)
- If cannot ventilate, **DO NOT proceed with paralysis** - see Section 5.2 (cannot ventilate scenario)
- Call for help

**Laryngoscopy and intubation (T+3 to T+5 minutes):**
- Insert laryngoscope (technique per Section 4.2)
- Visualize vocal cords
- Insert ETT under direct vision to appropriate depth
- Inflate cuff
- Confirm placement (see Section 6)
- Secure ETT

**Post-intubation (T+5 minutes onward):**
- Confirm bilateral breath sounds
- Verify EtCO₂ waveform
- Obtain post-intubation vital signs
- Adjust ventilator settings
- Secure ETT (tape or commercial device)
- Insert bite block
- Connect to anesthesia circuit
- Transition to maintenance phase

### 4.2 Mask Ventilation Technique

**Proper mask ventilation is a critical skill**

**Face mask application:**

**One-handed technique (if adequate):**
- Mask held with left hand (C-E grip):
  - **C:** Thumb and index finger form "C" on mask, creating seal
  - **E:** Middle, ring, and pinky fingers form "E" along mandible, lifting jaw forward
- Right hand ventilates (squeezes bag or activates ventilator)

**Two-handed technique (preferred, especially if difficult):**
- Both hands create mask seal and perform jaw thrust
- **Assistant** ventilates with bag
- **Technique:**
  - Thumbs and index fingers form "C" on each side of mask
  - Remaining fingers lift mandible forward ("jaw thrust")
  - Simultaneously create seal and open airway

**Jaw thrust maneuver:**
- Fingers behind angle of mandible
- Lift mandible forward and upward
- Displaces tongue anteriorly, opening pharynx
- **Critical** for effective mask ventilation

**Head position:**
- Maintain "sniffing position" (atlanto-occipital extension)
- Avoid excessive neck flexion (closes airway)

**Common mask ventilation problems and solutions:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Poor mask seal** | Two-handed technique; adjust mask size; remove beard (apply gel); use OPA |
| **Airway obstruction** | Jaw thrust; oral airway insertion; head extension; suction secretions |
| **Gastric insufflation** | Reduce peak inspiratory pressure (<20 cmH₂O); ensure adequate muscle relaxation before positive pressure |
| **Patient "fighting" ventilation** | Ensure adequate depth of anesthesia and muscle relaxation |
| **Oxygen desaturation despite ventilation** | Increase FiO₂ to 100%; apply PEEP 5-10 cmH₂O; consider lung pathology (bronchospasm, pneumothorax) |

**Adjuncts to improve mask ventilation:**

**Oropharyngeal airway (OPA):**
- Sizing: Corner of mouth to angle of jaw
- Insertion: Insert "upside down" (concave toward palate), rotate 180° as it passes soft palate
- Alternative: Insert with tongue depressor, directly in anatomic position
- Purpose: Displaces tongue anteriorly, prevents posterior pharynx collapse

**Nasopharyngeal airway (NPA):**
- Sizing: Nare to tragus; diameter approximately patient's pinky finger
- Insertion: Lubricate well; insert perpendicular to face (not angled upward); advance gently until flange reaches nare
- Contraindications: Basilar skull fracture, significant coagulopathy, nasal obstruction
- Purpose: Bypasses nasopharyngeal obstruction; better tolerated in semi-conscious patients

**CPAP/PEEP:**
- Apply 5-10 cmH₂O positive pressure throughout respiratory cycle
- Recruits collapsed alveoli
- Improves oxygenation in obese patients, pulmonary disease

**Two-person technique:**
- One provider: Mask seal + jaw thrust (two hands)
- Second provider: Bag ventilation
- Most effective for truly difficult mask ventilation

### 4.3 Laryngoscopy and Intubation Technique

**Direct laryngoscopy (DL) - Macintosh blade (most common):**

**Patient positioning:**
- Sniffing position confirmed (ear-sternal notch alignment)
- Head elevated 8-10 cm
- Atlanto-occipital joint extended

**Laryngoscope insertion:**
1. Hold laryngoscope in **left hand** (regardless of provider hand dominance)
2. Open mouth with right hand (scissor technique: thumb on lower teeth, index on upper)
3. Insert blade into **right side of mouth**, sweeping tongue to left
4. Advance blade into vallecula (Macintosh) - the space between base of tongue and epiglottis
5. Lift **upward and forward** along axis of laryngoscope handle (45° angle)
   - **Do NOT lever or rock back** (uses upper teeth as fulcrum - causes dental injury)
6. Visualize glottis (vocal cords)

**Cormack-Lehane classification of laryngoscopic view:**

| Grade | View | Intubation Difficulty |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Grade 1** | Full view of glottis (vocal cords fully visible) | Easy |
| **Grade 2** | Partial view of glottis (posterior commissure visible, anterior cords not seen) | Usually manageable |
| **Grade 3** | Only epiglottis visible (no glottis) | Difficult |
| **Grade 4** | No glottis or epiglottis visible (only soft palate) | Very difficult/impossible |

**If Grade 3 or 4 view:**
- See Section 5 (Difficult Airway Management)
- Do NOT make multiple attempts - risk of trauma and edema

**Improving laryngoscopic view (BURP maneuver):**
- **B**ackward - **U**pward - **R**ightward **P**ressure on thyroid cartilage
- Have assistant apply gentle external laryngeal pressure
- Improves view by ~1 Cormack-Lehane grade in many patients
- **Different from cricoid pressure** (Sellick maneuver)

**Endotracheal tube insertion:**
1. Visualize vocal cords
2. Insert ETT from **right side of mouth** (avoids obstructing view)
3. Watch ETT pass through cords until cuff is 1-2 cm below cords
4. Remove laryngoscope
5. Hold ETT firmly at mouth (prevent displacement)
6. Inflate cuff (5-10 mL air) until no leak heard
7. Confirm placement (see Section 6)

**Alternative: Miller blade (straight blade):**
- Technique differs: Blade **directly lifts epiglottis** (rather than vallecula)
- May provide better view in anterior larynx
- Useful when Macintosh unsuccessful

**Video laryngoscopy technique:**
- Similar insertion to DL
- **Look at screen, not patient**
- May require more acutely angled stylet
- Advance ETT while watching screen
- Once ETT in view, coordinate advancement toward cords
- May need to reduce angle of blade to allow ETT passage

**Stylet use:**
- Malleable aluminum or plastic stylet inserted into ETT
- Bent to form gentle "hockey stick" curve
- Facilitates directing ETT anteriorly toward glottis
- **Stop stylet 1 cm before ETT tip** (prevents tracheal trauma)
- Lubricate stylet for easy removal
- Remove after ETT placed through cords

**Bougie (Eschmann tracheal introducer):**
- Gum elastic or plastic bougie, 60-70 cm long
- Used when Grade 2B or 3 view (cannot see cords clearly)
- **Technique:**
  1. Insert bougie blindly beneath epiglottis, angled anteriorly
  2. Advance gently - if in trachea, will feel "clicks" as tip passes tracheal rings
  3. Resistance at ~40 cm suggests bronchial hold-up (confirms tracheal placement)
  4. Railroad ETT over bougie into trachea
  5. Remove bougie while holding ETT firmly
- **Critical skill** for Grade 3 laryngoscopy

**Time limits for laryngoscopy attempts:**
- Single attempt should not exceed 30 seconds
- If SpO₂ declining, abort attempt and mask ventilate
- **Do NOT make prolonged, repeated attempts** - causes trauma, edema, bleeding, worsens subsequent attempts

**Failed first attempt - before second attempt:**
- Re-oxygenate with mask ventilation (return SpO₂ to >95%)
- Optimize patient position
- Consider:
  - Different blade (Macintosh ↔ Miller)
  - Different blade size
  - External laryngeal manipulation (BURP)
  - Video laryngoscope
  - Bougie
  - More experienced operator
- **Maximum 3 attempts by experienced operator** before declaring failed intubation and moving to rescue algorithm

### 4.4 Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)

**RSI: Technique to secure airway rapidly while minimizing aspiration risk**

**Indications for RSI in rTKA (uncommon):**
- Inadequate NPO status (recent oral intake)
- High aspiration risk (severe GERD, gastroparesis, bowel obstruction)
- Full stomach from any cause
- Emergency case (not standard for elective rTKA)

**RSI differs from standard induction:**
- **No mask ventilation** between induction and intubation (minimize gastric insufflation)
- Rapid sequence of medications
- **Cricoid pressure** (controversial - see below)
- Higher dose neuromuscular blocker for faster onset

**RSI sequence:**

**Pre-oxygenation:**
- **Critical** - must achieve maximum deoxygenation reserve
- 3-5 minutes of 100% oxygen (EtO₂ >90%)
- Head-up position if possible

**Medications:**
1. **Induction agent:** Propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg IV or etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV (if hemodynamically unstable)
2. **Neuromuscular blocker:** Rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV (higher dose for faster onset ~60 seconds) OR succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV (fastest onset ~45 seconds)
   - **Succinylcholine rarely used** - contraindications include hyperkalemia risk, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, neuromuscular disease

**Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver) - CONTROVERSIAL:**
- **Technique:** Assistant applies firm pressure to cricoid cartilage, compressing esophagus against cervical vertebrae
- **Theory:** Prevents passive regurgitation of gastric contents
- **Evidence:** Effectiveness questioned; may worsen laryngoscopic view; may not reliably occlude esophagus
- **Current practice:** Institutional variability; many no longer routinely use
- **If used:** Apply as patient loses consciousness, maintain until ETT cuff inflated and placement confirmed; release if interfering with intubation or ventilation

**Apneic period:**
- **No positive pressure ventilation** (goal: prevent gastric insufflation)
- **Exception:** If SpO₂ declining significantly, gentle mask ventilation acceptable (aspiration risk < hypoxemia risk)
- Proceed directly to laryngoscopy once adequate relaxation achieved

**Intubation:**
- Single, optimized attempt
- Experienced operator preferred
- Video laryngoscopy reasonable first choice

**Post-intubation:**
- Confirm placement immediately
- Inflate cuff
- Release cricoid pressure (if used)
- Confirm bilateral breath sounds, EtCO₂ waveform

**Failed RSI:**
- See Section 5.3 (Cannot Intubate, Can Oxygenate)
- Maintain oxygenation (mask ventilation despite aspiration risk - hypoxemia more immediately life-threatening)
- Call for help
- Follow difficult airway algorithm

## 5. Difficult Airway Management

### 5.1 ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm - Overview

**The ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm provides systematic approach to anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway**

**Algorithm structure:**

**Two main pathways:**
1. **Anticipated difficult airway** (identified on preoperative assessment)
2. **Unanticipated difficult airway** (discovered during induction)

**Key decision points:**
- Can you **ventilate** with mask/SGA?
- Can you **intubate**?
- Is this an **emergency** (cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate - CICO)?

**Core principles:**
- **Call for help early**
- **Maintain oxygenation** (primary goal)
- **Limit number of attempts** (prevent trauma)
- **Have a Plan A, B, C, D**
- **Awaken patient** if elective case and cannot establish safe airway
- **Emergency airway** (surgical cricothyrotomy) if CICO situation

**Copies of ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm should be:**
- Posted in every OR and airway management area
- Included in difficult airway cart
- Familiar to all anesthesia providers

### 5.2 Anticipated Difficult Airway

**If preoperative assessment predicts difficult airway:**

**Preparation before induction:**
- Detailed discussion with patient (informed consent for awake intubation if planned)
- Difficult airway cart in room
- Additional experienced provider available/notified
- Equipment ready (fiberoptic bronchoscope, video laryngoscope, etc.)
- Plan A, B, C formulated and communicated to team
- Ensure adequate topical anesthesia and sedation medications available if awake approach

**Options for anticipated difficult airway:**

**Option 1: Awake fiberoptic intubation (gold standard for predicted difficult airway)**
- Maintains spontaneous ventilation and airway reflexes
- Allows assessment of airway patency throughout
- Patient cooperation required
- See Section 5.4 for technique

**Option 2: Modified induction with maintained spontaneous ventilation**
- Inhalational induction (sevoflurane)
- Titrate to unconsciousness while maintaining spontaneous breathing
- Assess mask ventilation before giving muscle relaxant
- Proceed to intubation only if can ventilate
- **Rarely used in modern practice** (awake fiberoptic preferred)

**Option 3: Optimized standard induction with enhanced preparation**
- If difficulty predicted but judged manageable
- Video laryngoscope ready as first choice
- Bougie immediately available
- Experienced operator performing intubation
- Difficult airway cart in room
- Team briefed on backup plans

**Option 4: Consider alternative anesthetic technique**
- Regional anesthesia (neuraxial or peripheral blocks) if feasible
- Avoid general anesthesia if possible
- **Not typically feasible for rTKA** (surgery requires general anesthesia or very deep sedation)

**Documentation of plan:**
- Primary technique planned
- Backup techniques if primary fails
- Point at which will abandon attempts and awaken patient (if elective)
- Emergency airway plan if CICO
- All team members aware of plan

### 5.3 Unanticipated Difficult Airway - Cannot Intubate, Can Oxygenate

**Scenario:** Standard induction performed, intubation attempted but unsuccessful, BUT able to maintain oxygenation with mask or supraglottic airway

**This is the MOST COMMON difficult airway scenario**

**Immediate actions:**
1. **STOP intubation attempts** (after maximum 3 attempts)
2. **Maintain oxygenation** with mask ventilation or place supraglottic airway (LMA)
3. **Call for help**
4. **Declare difficult airway** to team

**Assessment:**
- Is patient adequately oxygenated? (SpO₂ >90%)
- Is ventilation adequate? (EtCO₂ 35-45 mmHg, chest rise)
- Is this an emergency or elective case?
- Can case proceed with supraglottic airway or must patient be intubated?

**Management options:**

**Option 1: Awaken patient (if elective case and intubation required)**
- Reverse neuromuscular blockade (sugammadex 16 mg/kg for immediate reversal if needed)
- Allow patient to resume spontaneous ventilation
- Extubate/remove airway when fully awake
- Cancel or postpone case
- Re-evaluate: Awake fiberoptic intubation on next attempt, or consider regional technique

**Option 2: Proceed with supraglottic airway (if acceptable for surgery)**
- Place LMA or other supraglottic device
- Confirm adequate ventilation
- **For rTKA:** Generally NOT acceptable (case requires intubation for airway protection, positioning, duration)
- May be acceptable for very short cases with favorable anatomy

**Option 3: Alternative intubation technique**
- Video laryngoscopy (if not already attempted)
- Fiberoptic intubation through supraglottic airway
- Different blade or operator
- **Only if:** Experienced with technique, patient stable, adequate oxygenation

**Option 4: Fiberoptic intubation (through LMA or other SGA)**
- Place LMA, confirm ventilation
- Pass fiberoptic scope through LMA
- Visualize cords through scope
- Railroad ETT over scope into trachea
- Remove LMA, leaving ETT in place
- **Requires:** Expertise, appropriate equipment, stable patient

**Critical decision:**
- If **elective case** and cannot secure airway safely: **AWAKEN PATIENT**
- If **emergency case** and adequate oxygenation: Consider proceeding with best available airway (SGA) or continue attempts with most experienced operator and optimal equipment

**Documentation:**
- Failed intubation event documented
- Number of attempts, operators, techniques tried
- Final airway management strategy
- Patient outcome
- Plan communicated to patient postoperatively
- MedicAlert bracelet recommended for patient

### 5.4 Awake Fiberoptic Intubation

**Gold standard for anticipated difficult airway**

**Indications:**
- Known or predicted difficult intubation with concern for ability to mask ventilate
- Previous failed intubation
- Severe airway pathology (tumor, abscess, trauma)
- Cervical spine instability requiring careful airway management
- Morbid obesity with predicted difficult mask ventilation

**Contraindications:**
- Patient refusal
- Unable to cooperate (altered mental status, language barrier, severe anxiety)
- Airway hemorrhage (obscures view)
- True local anesthetic allergy (rare)

**Preparation:**

**Equipment:**
- Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (appropriate diameter for planned ETT size)
- Light source functioning
- Anti-fog solution
- ETT (load onto scope before procedure)
- Bite block
- Topical anesthesia supplies (see below)
- Supplemental oxygen (nasal cannula)
- Sedation medications
- Full monitoring (pulse oximetry, ECG, NIBP, capnography)

**Patient preparation:**
- Detailed explanation and consent
- NPO status confirmed
- IV access established
- Standard monitoring
- Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula
- Semi-upright positioning (30-45 degrees) - improves patient comfort and upper airway anatomy

**Topical anesthesia (airway blocks):**

**Goal:** Anesthetize airway mucosa to suppress cough and gag reflexes

**Techniques:**

**1. Nebulized lidocaine:**
- 4% lidocaine 3-5 mL via nebulizer
- Patient breathes nebulized anesthetic for 10-15 minutes
- Provides generalized airway anesthesia
- Simple, well-tolerated

**2. "Spray-as-you-go" technique:**
- Lidocaine 4% spray through working channel of fiberoptic scope
- Spray pharynx, then vocal cords, then trachea sequentially as scope advances
- Immediate anesthesia where needed
- Can be combined with other techniques

**3. Glossopharyngeal nerve block:**
- Anesthetizes posterior third of tongue and pharynx
- Bilateral tonsillar pillar blocks with 2% lidocaine
- Useful adjunct

**4. Superior laryngeal nerve block:**
- Anesthetizes supraglottic larynx (epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds)
- Injection at thyrohyoid membrane or transtracheal approach
- Requires expertise; higher risk

**5. Transtracheal block:**
- Anesthetizes trachea and subglottic larynx
- Injection through cricothyroid membrane
- 4% lidocaine 3-4 mL
- Causes coughing (distributes anesthetic) - warn patient
- Higher risk technique; institutional variability in use

**Maximum safe lidocaine dose:**
- 4-5 mg/kg (without epinephrine)
- 7 mg/kg (with epinephrine, if used in blocks)
- Monitor total dose from all sources
- Toxicity risk: CNS symptoms (perioral numbness, tinnitus, seizures)

**Sedation:**
- **Goal:** Anxiolysis and comfort while maintaining cooperation
- **Light to moderate sedation only** - must maintain airway reflexes and ability to follow commands

**Medications (examples, titrate to effect):**
- Midazolam 1-2 mg IV (small increments)
- Fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV
- Dexmedetomidine 0.5-1 mcg/kg load over 10 min, then 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hr
  - Provides sedation without respiratory depression
  - Patient remains arousable
  - Reduces secretions
- **Avoid over-sedation** - causes airway obstruction, aspiration risk

**Fiberoptic intubation technique:**

**Nasal vs oral approach:**
- **Nasal** often easier (straighter path to glottis, scope stabilized by nares)
- **Oral** preferred if nasal contraindication (coagulopathy, basilar skull fracture)

**Nasal approach:**
1. Apply vasoconstrictor to nasal mucosa (oxymetazoline spray or cocaine 4%)
2. Choose larger nare (ask patient which side "breathes better")
3. Lubricate scope and nare
4. Lubricate and prepare nasal ETT (typically 6.5-7.0 mm for nasal route)
5. Insert scope perpendicular to face (not angled upward) - follow floor of nose
6. Advance through nasopharynx to visualize epiglottis and vocal cords
7. Pass scope through cords into trachea (confirm tracheal rings visible)
8. Railroad ETT over scope into trachea
9. Remove scope while holding ETT firmly
10. Inflate cuff, confirm placement, proceed with general anesthesia

**Oral approach:**
1. Insert bite block (protect scope from patient biting)
2. May use oral airway as conduit for scope
3. Midline tongue displacement (retract with gauze if needed)
4. Visualize epiglottis, then cords
5. Pass through cords into trachea
6. Railroad ETT over scope
7. Remove scope, confirm placement

**Common challenges:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Fogging of scope** | Anti-fog solution; warm scope; intermittent removal and wiping |
| **Secretions obscuring view** | Suction through scope working channel; antisialagogue (glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV pretreatment) |
| **Bleeding** | Vasoconstrictor; gentle technique; suction; may need to abort and try alternate approach |
| **Patient coughing** | More topical anesthesia; gentle technique; reassure patient |
| **Cannot pass ETT over scope** | Rotate ETT 90° counterclockwise; withdraw scope slightly; warm/soften ETT in warm water; smaller ETT |
| **Patient panic/intolerance** | More sedation (cautiously); reassurance; consider abandoning attempt |

**Post-intubation:**
- Confirm ETT placement (EtCO₂, bilateral breath sounds, fiber-optic view if scope still in place)
- Secure ETT
- Induce general anesthesia
- Proceed with surgery

**Failed awake fiberoptic intubation:**
- Multiple attempts risk trauma and patient intolerance
- Consider: Alternative approach (nasal vs oral), more experienced operator, postpone case
- **Have plan for emergency airway** if patient loses airway during attempts

### 5.5 Cannot Intubate, Cannot Oxygenate (CICO)

**CICO: Life-threatening emergency - inability to intubate AND inability to maintain adequate oxygenation**

**Definition:**
- Failed intubation (after optimal attempts)
- Failed mask ventilation
- Failed supraglottic airway ventilation (if attempted)
- Oxygen saturation declining despite all efforts
- **This is a "can't ventilate" situation - face imminent hypoxic cardiac arrest**

**Incidence:** Rare (~1 in 50,000 anesthetics) but catastrophic if not managed correctly

**Recognition:**
- SpO₂ declining despite maximal efforts
- Unable to deliver any tidal volume (no chest rise, no EtCO₂)
- Rapidly progressing to severe hypoxemia (SpO₂ <80%, continuing to fall)

**Immediate actions (CICO algorithm):**

**1. DECLARE EMERGENCY:**
- **Call for help** - state "Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate"
- Activate emergency response
- Assign roles (someone to perform cricothyrotomy, someone to continue attempting ventilation, someone to get emergency airway equipment)

**2. FINAL ATTEMPT AT OXYGENATION (while preparing for surgical airway):**
- Optimal two-person mask ventilation with:
  - 100% oxygen
  - Oral and nasal airways
  - Two-handed jaw thrust and mask seal
  - Assistant bag ventilation
  - High pressure (accept risk of gastric insufflation)
- OR attempt supraglottic airway (LMA) if not already tried
  - Place largest size LMA
  - Attempt ventilation
  - May attempt intubation through LMA with fiberoptic scope if expertise immediately available

**3. IF STILL CANNOT OXYGENATE:**
- **PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO EMERGENCY SURGICAL AIRWAY**
- Do NOT delay with further futile attempts at other techniques
- Hypoxic brain injury begins after 3-5 minutes
- Hypoxic cardiac arrest after 5-8 minutes

**Emergency surgical airway - Cricothyrotomy:**

**Scalpel cricothyrotomy (preferred technique):**

**Landmarks:**
- Identify thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple)
- Identify cricoid cartilage (first firm ring below thyroid)
- **Cricothyroid membrane** - soft depression between thyroid and cricoid cartilages

**Technique (scalpel-bougie-tube method):**

1. **Stabilize larynx** with non-dominant hand
2. **Palpate cricothyroid membrane** (between thyroid and cricoid cartilages)
3. **Make transverse incision** through skin and cricothyroid membrane with scalpel (#10 or #20 blade)
   - Generous incision (3-4 cm skin, through entire membrane)
4. **Insert bougie** through membrane into trachea, directed caudally
   - Feel tracheal clicks as confirmation
5. **Railroad small ETT** (6.0 or 6.5 mm) or tracheostomy tube over bougie into trachea
6. **Remove bougie**, inflate cuff
7. **Ventilate and confirm placement** (chest rise, EtCO₂)
8. **Secure tube**

**Alternative: Commercial cricothyrotomy kits**
- Many institutions stock commercial kits (QuickTrach, Melker, etc.)
- Follow manufacturer instructions
- **Practice with kit before emergency** (simulation)
- Generally involve: Needle puncture, guidewire, dilator, airway catheter

**Needle cricothyrotomy (temporizing only):**
- Large-bore IV catheter (14-16 gauge) through cricothyroid membrane
- Attach to high-pressure oxygen source (jet ventilation)
- **Provides oxygenation but NOT ventilation** (CO₂ accumulates)
- Buys time (~30-45 minutes) but definitive airway still needed
- Risk of barotrauma, subcutaneous emphysema
- **Not recommended as primary technique** - scalpel cricothyrotomy preferred

**Post-cricothyrotomy:**
- Confirm placement (auscultation, EtCO₂, chest X-ray when stable)
- Secure airway
- Stabilize patient hemodynamically
- ENT or surgery consultation for definitive airway management
- ICU admission
- Debrief with team
- Inform patient and family
- Institutional reporting and review

**Prevention of CICO:**
- Thorough preoperative airway assessment
- Early recognition of difficult airway
- Call for help early in difficult airway situation
- Limit intubation attempts (maximum 3)
- Maintain oxygenation throughout (use SGA if needed)
- Do NOT persist with failing technique
- Have emergency airway equipment immediately available

## 6. Endotracheal Tube Management and Confirmation

### 6.1 Confirmation of Endotracheal Tube Placement

**CRITICAL: Must confirm ETT in trachea, not esophagus**

**Unrecognized esophageal intubation is catastrophic**

**Primary confirmation method (GOLD STANDARD):**

**Continuous waveform capnography (EtCO₂):**
- **Most reliable** method of confirming tracheal placement
- Presence of EtCO₂ waveform confirms ETT in airway (trachea or bronchus)
- **Absence of EtCO₂ waveform suggests esophageal intubation**
  - Exception: Cardiac arrest (no pulmonary blood flow, no CO₂ return)
- **Sustained EtCO₂ over multiple breaths** (≥6 breaths) essentially confirms tracheal placement

**EtCO₂ waveform characteristics:**
- Normal: Square wave, plateau, return to baseline
- Value typically 35-45 mmHg
- Cycle with each ventilation

**If NO EtCO₂ waveform after intubation:**
- **ASSUME ESOPHAGEAL INTUBATION until proven otherwise**
- Remove ETT immediately
- Re-oxygenate with mask ventilation
- Re-attempt intubation

**Secondary confirmation methods (use in addition to capnography):**

**Auscultation:**
- Listen over both lung fields (axillae) - should hear bilateral breath sounds
- Listen over epigastrium - should NOT hear gurgling (suggests esophageal)
- **Unreliable as sole method** - transmitted sounds can be misleading

**Chest rise:**
- Visualize symmetric chest expansion with ventilation
- **Unreliable alone** - can see chest rise with esophageal intubation (gastric insufflation)

**Mist in ETT:**
- Condensation visible in tube with exhalation
- Supportive but not definitive

**Direct visualization:**
- ETT observed passing through vocal cords during laryngoscopy
- Most reliable if clearly visualized
- **Not always certain** - cords may be difficult to see

**Esophageal detector device:**
- Bulb or syringe attached to ETT
- If in trachea: Rigid tracheal rings allow air aspiration (bulb re-inflates or syringe easily withdrawn)
- If in esophagus: Collapse of esophagus prevents air aspiration
- **Less commonly used** with widespread capnography availability

**Fiberoptic visualization:**
- Pass fiberoptic scope through ETT
- Visualize tracheal rings (confirms tracheal placement)
- Definitive but time-consuming; not routinely needed

**Confirmation checklist immediately after intubation:**

- [ ] EtCO₂ waveform present and sustained (PRIMARY)
- [ ] Bilateral breath sounds auscultated
- [ ] No epigastric sounds
- [ ] Symmetric chest rise
- [ ] ETT depth appropriate (see Section 6.2)
- [ ] SpO₂ stable or improving
- [ ] Condensation visible in ETT

**If ANY doubt about placement:**
- **Remove ETT and re-oxygenate with mask**
- Do NOT proceed if uncertain
- "When in doubt, take it out"

### 6.2 Endotracheal Tube Depth and Position

**Correct ETT depth:**
- Tip should be **3-5 cm above carina** (mid-trachea)
- Too shallow: Risk of accidental extubation, cuff above cords (leak)
- Too deep: Endobronchial intubation (typically right mainstem)

**Estimating correct depth:**

**Distance at teeth/lips:**
- **Adult males:** Typically 22-24 cm at teeth
- **Adult females:** Typically 20-22 cm at teeth
- **General rule:** ETT size (ID) × 3 = depth at teeth
  - Example: 7.5 mm ETT → 7.5 × 3 = 22.5 cm at teeth

**Adjust depth based on:**
- Patient height (taller → deeper)
- Neck position (flexion moves tip deeper, extension moves tip shallower)
- Actual auscultation findings

**Detection of endobronchial intubation:**

**Clinical signs:**
- **Unilateral breath sounds** (diminished or absent on left with right mainstem)
- Elevated peak inspiratory pressures
- Decreased tidal volumes (if volume-control ventilation)
- Declining SpO₂ (from atelectasis of non-ventilated lung)
- Asymmetric chest rise

**Capnography:**
- May show decreased EtCO₂ (from increased dead space)
- Waveform may be altered

**Management:**
- Deflate cuff
- Withdraw ETT 1-2 cm
- Re-inflate cuff
- Reassess breath sounds bilaterally
- Confirm improved ventilation

**Securing ETT:**
- Note and document depth at teeth/lips
- Secure with tape or commercial ETT holder
- Ensure tube will not move with patient positioning or during surgery
- **Insert bite block** (prevents patient biting and occluding ETT)
- Reconfirm depth after any patient repositioning

### 6.3 Endotracheal Tube Cuff Management

**Purpose of ETT cuff:**
- Create seal to allow positive pressure ventilation
- Prevent aspiration of pharyngeal secretions
- Maintain circuit integrity

**Cuff inflation:**
- Inflate with air (typically 5-10 mL)
- Inflate until **no leak** heard during positive pressure ventilation
- **Minimal leak technique:** Inflate until leak just disappears
- Avoid over-inflation (tracheal mucosal ischemia)

**Cuff pressure:**
- Recommended: **20-30 cm H₂O** (prevents both leak and mucosal injury)
- Pressures >30 cmH₂O can compromise tracheal capillary perfusion
- Cuff manometer available in many institutions (measure and adjust pressure)

**Intraoperative cuff management:**
- Check cuff periodically (especially if leak develops)
- Nitrous oxide diffusion into cuff (if N₂O used): Can increase cuff pressure over time
  - N₂O rarely used in modern ERAS pathways
- Repositioning patient: Recheck cuff pressure and ETT depth

**Cuff issues:**

| Problem | Manifestation | Management |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Cuff leak** | Audible leak, decreased tidal volumes, unable to maintain airway pressure | Inflate cuff further; if persistent, may need to advance ETT slightly or replace ETT |
| **Cuff herniation** | Sudden large leak | Deflate, reposition ETT, re-inflate |
| **Cuff rupture** | Unable to inflate, persistent leak | Replace ETT (if surgery not imminent, may attempt to continue with leak) |

## 7. Intraoperative Ventilation and Respiratory Management

### 7.1 Mechanical Ventilation Modes

**For rTKA general anesthesia: Controlled mechanical ventilation standard**

**Volume-control ventilation (VCV):**
- Set tidal volume delivered with each breath
- Ventilator delivers set volume regardless of pressure required
- **Advantages:** Guaranteed minute ventilation; consistent tidal volumes
- **Disadvantages:** Variable airway pressures (risk of barotrauma if compliance poor)

**Typical settings for rTKA:**
- **Tidal volume:** 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight
  - Example: 70 kg patient (ideal body weight ~70 kg) → 420-560 mL
  - Use **ideal body weight** not actual weight (especially in obese patients)
- **Respiratory rate:** 10-14 breaths/min (adjust to target EtCO₂)
- **I:E ratio:** 1:2 (inspiratory:expiratory time)
- **PEEP:** 5 cmH₂O standard; consider 8-10 cmH₂O in obese or pulmonary disease
- **FiO₂:** 0.4-0.6 (40-60%) typical; titrate to SpO₂ >95%

**Pressure-control ventilation (PCV):**
- Set inspiratory pressure delivered
- Tidal volume varies based on lung compliance
- **Advantages:** Limits peak airway pressure; may improve oxygenation in some patients
- **Disadvantages:** Variable tidal volumes; requires monitoring to ensure adequate minute ventilation
- Less commonly used for routine rTKA

**Pressure-support ventilation (PSV):**
- Patient-triggered breaths with pressure support
- Requires spontaneous respiratory effort
- **Not typical for rTKA** (full muscle relaxation standard)

### 7.2 Lung-Protective Ventilation

**Goal: Minimize ventilator-induced lung injury**

**Principles:**

**Low tidal volume:**
- **6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight** (NOT actual weight)
- Reduces alveolar overdistension
- Supported by ARDS literature; principles apply to intraoperative ventilation

**PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure):**
- **5 cmH₂O minimum** (prevents atelectasis)
- **8-10 cmH₂O** in obese patients or pulmonary disease
- Recruits collapsed alveoli
- Improves oxygenation and lung compliance

**Limit plateau pressure:**
- Plateau pressure (pressure during inspiratory hold) <30 cmH₂O ideal
- Excessive plateau pressure → alveolar overdistension

**Recruitment maneuvers:**
- Periodic sustained inflation (30-40 cmH₂O for 30-40 seconds)
- Recruits atelectatic alveoli
- May improve oxygenation
- **Use cautiously** - can cause hemodynamic compromise (decreased venous return)
- Consider in patients with declining oxygenation or significant atelectasis

**FiO₂:**
- Use **lowest FiO₂** to maintain SpO₂ >95%
- Excessive oxygen may contribute to atelectasis (absorption atelectasis)
- Typical: FiO₂ 0.4-0.6 (40-60%) for most patients
- Titrate based on pulse oximetry and patient risk factors

**Avoid high peak airway pressures:**
- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) <30 cmH₂O preferred
- Plateau pressure <30 cmH₂O (measured during inspiratory hold)
- High pressures increase risk of barotrauma and ventilator-induced lung injury

**Intraoperative lung-protective ventilation summary:**

| Parameter | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Tidal volume** | 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight | Prevent alveolar overdistension |
| **PEEP** | 5-10 cmH₂O | Prevent atelectasis; recruit alveoli |
| **Plateau pressure** | <30 cmH₂O | Limit barotrauma risk |
| **FiO₂** | 0.4-0.6 (titrate to SpO₂) | Minimize absorption atelectasis and oxygen toxicity |
| **Respiratory rate** | Adjust to EtCO₂ 35-45 mmHg | Maintain normocapnia |

### 7.3 Monitoring Ventilation and Oxygenation

**Continuous intraoperative monitoring (mandatory):**

**Pulse oximetry (SpO₂):**
- Continuous display
- Alarms enabled (typically low alarm 90-92%)
- Target: SpO₂ ≥95% (≥92% acceptable in some patients with chronic lung disease)
- Trends more important than single values

**Capnography (EtCO₂):**
- Continuous waveform display
- Numeric EtCO₂ value displayed
- Target: 35-45 mmHg (adjust based on patient needs)
- **Waveform analysis critical:**
  - Normal: Square wave with plateau
  - Abnormal waveforms suggest ventilation problems (see Section 7.4)

**Airway pressures:**
- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) displayed continuously
- Monitor for trends (increasing pressure suggests decreasing compliance)
- Plateau pressure (if measured): Alveolar pressure during inspiratory hold
- PEEP level confirmed

**Tidal volumes:**
- Delivered tidal volume displayed
- Expired tidal volume monitored
- Discrepancy suggests leak or disconnection

**Respiratory rate:**
- Set rate confirmed
- Actual rate displayed

**FiO₂:**
- Inspired oxygen concentration monitored via oxygen analyzer in circuit
- Ensures correct oxygen delivery
- Low oxygen alarm enabled

**Intermittent assessment:**

**Auscultation:**
- Breath sounds checked after intubation, after positioning, and if ventilation concerns
- Bilateral, symmetric breath sounds expected

**Arterial blood gas (ABG):**
- Not routine for rTKA
- Consider if:
  - Significant pulmonary disease
  - Ventilation/oxygenation concerns
  - Hemodynamic instability
  - Metabolic derangements suspected
- Provides: pH, PaCO₂, PaO₂, bicarbonate, base excess, lactate

**SpO₂/FiO₂ ratio:**
- Non-invasive estimate of oxygenation
- SpO₂/FiO₂ <200 suggests impaired gas exchange
- Alternative to PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio when ABG not available

### 7.4 Intraoperative Ventilation Troubleshooting

**Common ventilation problems and solutions:**

**Problem 1: Hypoxemia (SpO₂ declining)**

**Causes and management:**

| Cause | Clinical Clues | Management |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Inadequate FiO₂** | FiO₂ analyzer shows low oxygen | Increase FiO₂ to 100%; check oxygen source |
| **Endobronchial intubation** | Unilateral breath sounds, high PIP | Withdraw ETT 1-2 cm, recheck breath sounds |
| **ETT obstruction** | High PIP, no air movement, no EtCO₂ waveform | Pass suction catheter; if obstructed, replace ETT |
| **Pneumothorax** | Sudden onset, unilateral breath sounds, high PIP, hemodynamic compromise | Needle decompression if tension; chest tube; call for help |
| **Atelectasis** | Gradual onset, decreased compliance | Recruitment maneuver; increase PEEP; optimize ventilation |
| **Bronchospasm** | Wheezing, high PIP, prolonged expiratory phase, upsloping EtCO₂ | Deepen anesthesia; bronchodilators (albuterol, glycopyrrolate); treat trigger |
| **Aspiration** | Often during induction, sudden desaturation, may have gastric contents in airway | Suction airway; increase FiO₂ and PEEP; consider bronchoscopy; CXR; ICU |
| **Pulmonary embolism** | Sudden onset, may have hemodynamic instability, increased dead space (↑EtCO₂ gap) | Supportive care; increase FiO₂; hemodynamic support; diagnostic workup |
| **Circuit disconnection** | Sudden loss of ventilation, no chest rise, alarms | Reconnect circuit; hand ventilate; check all connections |
| **Mucus plug** | Gradual or sudden, decreased breath sounds, high PIP | Suction via ETT; chest physiotherapy; recruitment |

**Problem 2: Hypercarbia (EtCO₂ elevated)**

**Causes and management:**

| Cause | Clinical Clues | Management |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Hypoventilation** | Low respiratory rate or tidal volume | Increase respiratory rate or tidal volume |
| **Increased CO₂ production** | Fever, malignant hyperthermia, sepsis, overfeeding, hypermetabolic state | Treat underlying cause; increase minute ventilation |
| **Rebreathing** | Exhausted CO₂ absorbent, incompetent valves in circuit | Replace CO₂ absorbent; check circuit valves; increase fresh gas flow |
| **Bronchospasm** | High PIP, wheezing, prolonged expiration, upsloping EtCO₂ waveform | Deepen anesthesia; bronchodilators; allow longer expiratory time |
| **Laparoscopic insufflation** | Not applicable to rTKA (open procedure) | N/A |

**Problem 3: High peak airway pressures**

**Causes and management:**

| Cause | Clinical Clues | Management |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Bronchospasm** | Wheezing, prolonged expiration, upsloping EtCO₂ | Deepen anesthesia; bronchodilators; identify and remove trigger |
| **Endobronchial intubation** | Unilateral breath sounds, hypoxemia | Withdraw ETT 1-2 cm; confirm bilateral breath sounds |
| **ETT obstruction** | Sudden onset, no air movement | Suction; if ineffective, replace ETT |
| **Pneumothorax** | Sudden onset, unilateral breath sounds, hypoxemia, hemodynamic compromise | Needle decompression; chest tube |
| **Pulmonary edema** | Gradual onset, decreased compliance, hypoxemia, fluid overload | Diuresis; optimize hemodynamics; increase PEEP |
| **Patient coughing/bucking** | Inadequate paralysis or anesthetic depth | Deepen anesthesia; ensure adequate neuromuscular blockade; check if patient awakening |
| **Obesity** | Baseline high pressures due to chest wall/abdominal mass | Optimize positioning (reverse Trendelenburg); adequate PEEP; accept higher baseline pressures |
| **ARDS/pneumonia** | Decreased compliance, hypoxemia, infiltrates on CXR | Lung-protective ventilation; PEEP; treat underlying cause |

**Problem 4: Abnormal capnography waveform**

**Capnography waveform interpretation:**

| Waveform Pattern | Cause | Management |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| **Gradual upsloping plateau** | Bronchospasm, COPD, prolonged expiration | Bronchodilators; deepen anesthesia; allow longer expiratory time |
| **Sudden drop to zero** | Disconnection, esophageal intubation, ETT obstruction, cardiac arrest | Check circuit; confirm ETT placement; assess patient and circulation |
| **Gradual decline** | Decreasing cardiac output, hypothermia, pulmonary embolism | Assess hemodynamics; treat underlying cause |
| **Gradual rise** | Hypoventilation, hypermetabolism (fever, MH), CO₂ absorbent exhausted | Increase minute ventilation; treat cause; replace absorbent if exhausted |
| **Baseline elevated above zero** | Rebreathing (incompetent valve, exhausted absorbent) | Replace CO₂ absorbent; check circuit valves; increase fresh gas flow |
| **Notch in plateau** | Spontaneous respiratory effort during controlled ventilation | Deepen anesthesia; ensure adequate neuromuscular blockade |
| **Oscillations on plateau** | Cardiogenic oscillations (transmitted from heartbeat) | Normal variant; no action needed |

### 7.5 Special Intraoperative Respiratory Considerations

**Positioning effects on ventilation:**

**Supine position (standard for rTKA):**
- Functional residual capacity (FRC) reduced compared to upright
- Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch may occur
- Obese patients particularly affected
- Maintain adequate PEEP to prevent atelectasis

**Tourniquet use:**
- Tourniquet inflation: Minimal respiratory effects
- Tourniquet deflation: Transient increase in venous return and CO₂ return to lungs
  - May see transient increase in EtCO₂
  - Usually clinically insignificant

**Bone cement implantation syndrome (rare):**
- Fat and marrow embolization during cementing
- Can cause hypoxemia, hypotension, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest (very rare)
- Monitor closely during cementing phase
- Be prepared for hemodynamic support

**Protocol-specific ventilation considerations:**

**Protocol 1 & 2 (OFIA pathways):**
- Standard lung-protective ventilation
- No special considerations related to anesthetic technique

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**
- Higher opioid doses may cause more respiratory depression in early recovery
- Ensure complete neuromuscular reversal before extubation
- More stringent extubation criteria (see Section 8)
- Enhanced postoperative respiratory monitoring

**Obesity considerations:**
- Use ideal body weight for tidal volume calculation
- Higher PEEP (8-10 cmH₂O) to maintain FRC
- Reverse Trendelenburg positioning if tolerated (improves lung mechanics)
- Recruitment maneuvers may be beneficial
- Anticipate faster desaturation if apneic

**OSA considerations:**
- Standard intraoperative ventilation
- Key differences are in emergence and postoperative management (see Sections 8 and 9)

## 8. Emergence and Extubation

### 8.1 Preparation for Emergence

**Timing:**
- Begin emergence preparation 10-15 minutes before anticipated end of surgery
- Coordinate with surgical team

**Emergence checklist:**

**Anesthetic adjustments:**
- [ ] Taper or stop adjunct infusions (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine if used)
- [ ] Reduce propofol infusion rate OR decrease sevoflurane concentration
- [ ] Ensure adequate analgesia administered
  - Multimodal analgesics given (acetaminophen, NSAIDs per protocol)
  - Regional blocks provide analgesia (Protocol 1)
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV for PONV prophylaxis
- [ ] Prepare for neuromuscular reversal (sugammadex drawn and ready)

**Patient assessment:**
- [ ] Hemodynamically stable
- [ ] No active bleeding
- [ ] Temperature ≥36°C (or warming in progress)
- [ ] Pain anticipated to be manageable

**Equipment:**
- [ ] Suction functioning and at bedside
- [ ] Oxygen delivery device ready (nasal cannula or face mask)
- [ ] Emergency airway equipment still available

**Ventilation transition:**
- [ ] Begin transitioning from controlled to assisted or spontaneous ventilation
- [ ] Reduce respiratory rate (allow patient to trigger breaths)
- [ ] Monitor for adequate spontaneous respiratory effort
- [ ] Maintain FiO₂ 40-60% during emergence

### 8.2 Neuromuscular Reversal

**Reversal is MANDATORY before extubation**

**Assessment of neuromuscular blockade:**

**Train-of-four (TOF) monitoring:**
- Performed before reversal administration
- Determines appropriate sugammadex dose:
  - **TOF count ≥2 twitches:** Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV
  - **TOF count 0-1 twitch (deep block):** Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV
  - **Post-tetanic count only (profound block):** Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV

**Sugammadex administration:**
- Dose based on **actual body weight** (not ideal body weight)
- Give as rapid IV push (over 10 seconds)
- Expect recovery within 2-5 minutes

**Post-reversal assessment:**
- Reassess TOF 2-5 minutes after sugammadex
- **Target: TOF ratio ≥0.9** (quantitative monitoring preferred)
- If TOF ratio <0.9, wait and reassess; consider additional sugammadex per institutional protocol

**Clinical assessment of neuromuscular recovery:**

**If quantitative TOF available:**
- **TOF ratio ≥0.9 is mandatory** before extubation
- Clinical tests supplement but do not replace objective monitoring

**If only qualitative TOF or clinical assessment available:**

| Test | Adequate Recovery | Inadequate Recovery |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Sustained head lift** | Lift head off bed for 5 seconds | Cannot lift or drops before 5 seconds |
| **Sustained leg raise** | Straight leg raise for 5 seconds | Cannot raise or drops quickly |
| **Hand grip** | Strong, sustained bilateral grip | Weak or cannot sustain |
| **Tongue protrusion** | Sustained tongue out | Weak or quickly retracts |
| **Vital capacity** | >15-20 mL/kg (if measured) | Low vital capacity |
| **Negative inspiratory force** | <-25 cmH₂O (if measured) | Inadequate inspiratory effort |
| **TOF (qualitative)** | Four equal twitches, no fade on tetanus | Fade on TOF or tetanus |

**IMPORTANT:** Clinical tests can miss residual blockade - quantitative monitoring strongly preferred

### 8.3 Extubation Criteria

**All criteria must be met before extubation:**

**Consciousness:**
- Awake and responsive to verbal commands
- Eyes open spontaneously or to voice

  - Respiratory rate 12-20 breaths/min (sustained, regular pattern)
- **Strong clinical strength:**
  - Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
  - Strong hand grip
  - Ability to lift legs off bed
- **DO NOT extubate if:**

### 8.4 Extubation Technique

**Standard extubation procedure:**

**Preparation:**
1. Patient in semi-upright position (30-45 degrees) if tolerated
2. Suction ready at bedside (Yankauer tip)
3. Supplemental oxygen ready (nasal cannula or face mask)
4. Monitoring in place and functioning
5. Assistant present

**Suctioning:**
1. Suction oropharynx thoroughly (remove secretions above cuff)
   - Use Yankauer suction
   - Avoid deep suctioning (causes laryngospasm)
2. Suction through ETT (remove tracheal secretions)
   - Brief suction with catheter through ETT
   - Avoid prolonged suctioning (causes hypoxemia)

**Extubation:**
1. Pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO₂ for 30-60 seconds
2. Ensure patient is taking spontaneous breaths
3. Deflate ETT cuff completely
4. **During positive pressure breath** OR **at peak of spontaneous inspiration:**
   - Remove ETT in single smooth motion
   - Rationale: Positive pressure blows secretions away from cords
5. Encourage patient to cough and deep breathe
6. Apply supplemental oxygen immediately (nasal cannula 2-4 L/min or face mask)

**Immediate post-extubation:**
1. Assess airway patency and ventilation
   - Listen for stridor (may indicate laryngospasm or edema)
   - Observe respiratory pattern
   - Monitor SpO₂
2. Encourage deep breathing and coughing
3. Remain at bedside until patient stable
4. Continue monitoring (pulse oximetry, ECG, NIBP every 2-3 minutes initially)

**Post-extubation oxygen therapy:**
- Nasal cannula 2-4 L/min (most common)
- Simple face mask 6-10 L/min (if higher FiO₂ needed)
- Non-rebreather mask 10-15 L/min (if significant hypoxemia)
- Titrate to SpO₂ ≥95% (≥92% acceptable in chronic lung disease)

### 8.5 Delayed Extubation

**Indications to DELAY extubation:**

**Respiratory:**
- Inadequate spontaneous ventilation (low tidal volume, high respiratory rate, irregular pattern)
- Hypoxemia (SpO₂ <92% on high FiO₂)
- Residual neuromuscular blockade (TOF ratio <0.9)
- Excessive secretions or blood in airway

**Neurologic:**
- Somnolence, difficult to arouse
- Not following commands
- Confusion, agitation (may improve with time or indicate problem)

**Hemodynamic:**
- Severe hypotension or hypertension
- Uncontrolled arrhythmias
- Active bleeding

**Airway:**
- Airway edema suspected (from prolonged intubation, multiple attempts, trauma)
- Concerns about ability to re-intubate if needed

**Surgical:**
- Surgeon requests delayed extubation (rare for rTKA)

**Management of delayed extubation:**
- Continue mechanical ventilation with appropriate settings
- Maintain adequate anesthesia/sedation (propofol infusion, volatile anesthetic)
- Reassess frequently (every 5-10 minutes)
- Consider causes of delayed emergence:
  - Excessive anesthetic depth (give time to metabolize)
  - Opioid excess (consider small-dose naloxone if severe - see Section 9)
  - Residual neuromuscular blockade (give additional sugammadex)
  - Metabolic disturbance (hypoglycemia, hypercarbia, hypothermia)
  - Neurologic event (stroke, seizure - very rare)
- If prolonged delay expected (>30-60 minutes), transfer to PACU or ICU intubated

---

## 9. Postoperative Airway Management

### 9.1 PACU Respiratory Monitoring

**Immediate post-extubation monitoring (see Patient Monitoring Standards document for complete details):**

**All patients:**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** until PACU discharge criteria met
- Supplemental oxygen therapy
- Respiratory rate assessment every 5-15 minutes initially
- Sedation score assessment (especially if opioids used)
- Airway patency and respiratory effort continuous observation

**Protocol-specific PACU respiratory monitoring:**

**Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK):**
- Standard PACU respiratory monitoring
- Minimal opioid exposure - low respiratory depression risk
- Continuous pulse oximetry minimum 1 hour
- Typically smooth respiratory course

**Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free):**
- Standard to enhanced monitoring depending on rescue opioid requirement
- If significant rescue opioids needed (e.g., hydromorphone >0.8-1 mg total):
  - Consider capnography
  - Extended continuous pulse oximetry (2+ hours)
  - Enhanced sedation monitoring

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) - ENHANCED MONITORING MANDATORY:**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry MANDATORY** until fully awake and stable (minimum 2 hours)
- **Capnography STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** for high-risk patients:
  - OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)
  - Age >70 with significant intraoperative opioid exposure
  - Obesity (BMI >35)
  - Any respiratory event or concern
- **Enhanced sedation monitoring:** Every 10-15 minutes (not every 30 minutes)
- **Naloxone immediately available at bedside**
- Lower threshold for extended monitoring or higher level of care

### 9.2 Post-Extubation Complications

**Airway obstruction:**

**Causes:**
- Tongue falling back (most common in sedated patients)
- Laryngospasm
- Laryngeal edema
- Foreign body (blood clot, tissue, secretions)
- Residual neuromuscular blockade

**Recognition:**
- Stridor (high-pitched inspiratory sound)
- Paradoxical chest/abdominal movement ("see-saw" breathing)
- Decreased or absent breath sounds
- Hypoxemia (SpO₂ declining)
- Increased respiratory effort (accessory muscles, nasal flaring)
- Agitation (from hypoxemia)

**Management:**
1. **Jaw thrust and head positioning**
   - Lift mandible forward
   - Extend atlanto-occipital joint
   - Often relieves tongue obstruction
2. **Oral or nasal airway**
   - Insert if jaw thrust insufficient
3. **Positive pressure ventilation**
   - Gentle bag-mask with 100% oxygen
   - May overcome partial obstruction
4. **If laryngospasm suspected:**
   - 100% oxygen
   - Positive pressure (CPAP 10 cmH₂O)
   - Deepen anesthesia (propofol 20-40 mg IV)
   - Small-dose succinylcholine (10-20 mg IV) if severe and unrelieved
   - Call for help; prepare for reintubation if needed
5. **If complete obstruction or worsening:**
   - Call for help
   - Prepare for reintubation
   - Consider emergency airway if cannot reintubate and cannot oxygenate

**Laryngospasm:**
- Reflex, sustained closure of vocal cords
- Triggered by: Secretions, blood, light anesthesia, instrumentation, airway irritation
- Complete laryngospasm: No air movement, cannot ventilate
- Partial laryngospasm: Stridor, difficult ventilation

**Treatment of laryngospasm:**
1. Remove stimulus if possible (suction secretions)
2. 100% oxygen via face mask
3. Positive pressure (CPAP 5-10 cmH₂O) - may "pop" through spasm
4. Jaw thrust (Larson's maneuver - firm pressure behind angle of mandible)
5. Deepen anesthesia: Propofol 20-50 mg IV
6. If severe/persistent:
   - Succinylcholine 10-20 mg IV (relaxes cords)
   - Prepare for mask ventilation after relaxation
   - Prepare for reintubation if needed
7. Call for help if not rapidly resolving

**Laryngeal edema:**
- Airway swelling causing obstruction
- Causes: Prolonged intubation, multiple intubation attempts, traumatic intubation, allergic reaction
- Symptoms: Stridor, hoarse voice, difficulty breathing
- May worsen over first few hours postoperatively

**Treatment:**
1. Supplemental oxygen
2. Keep patient calm and upright (sitting position)
3. **Racemic epinephrine nebulizer** (0.5 mL of 2.25% solution in 3 mL saline)
   - Provides temporary vasoconstriction and reduces edema
4. **Dexamethasone 8 mg IV** (if not already given; anti-inflammatory)
5. **Heliox** (helium-oxygen mixture) if available - reduces turbulent flow through narrowed airway
6. Monitor closely - may need reintubation if worsening
7. If severe or unresponsive:
   - Call ENT consultation
   - Prepare for possible reintubation or surgical airway

**Aspiration:**
- Inhalation of gastric contents into lungs
- Can occur during emergence if protective reflexes inadequate

**Recognition:**
- Witnessed regurgitation or vomiting
- Sudden coughing, choking
- Hypoxemia
- Wheezing (bronchospasm from acid)
- Tachypnea
- May have delayed presentation (hours later)

**Management:**
1. Immediate suctioning of oropharynx
2. Position patient head-down/lateral (prevent further aspiration)
3. Supplemental oxygen
4. If significant aspiration:
   - Consider reintubation and airway suctioning via bronchoscopy
   - Bronchodilators if bronchospasm (albuterol)
   - Avoid steroids (no proven benefit; may increase infection risk)
   - Antibiotics NOT routine (wait for signs of infection)
   - Chest X-ray
   - Possible ICU admission
   - Monitor for ARDS development (next 24-48 hours)

**Hypoventilation / Respiratory depression:**
- See Patient Monitoring Standards document, Section 11.2
- More common with Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive)

**Causes:**
- Residual anesthetic effects
- Opioid excess
- Residual neuromuscular blockade
- Airway obstruction

**Recognition:**
- Decreased respiratory rate (<10 breaths/min)
- Shallow breathing (low tidal volume)
- Hypoxemia (SpO₂ declining)
- Hypercarbia (elevated EtCO₂ if capnography available)
- Somnolence

**Management:**
1. Stimulate patient (verbal, tactile)
2. Encourage deep breathing
3. Supplemental oxygen
4. Assess cause:
   - Check TOF if residual blockade suspected (give additional sugammadex if needed)
   - If opioid-related and severe: Naloxone 0.04-0.08 mg IV titrated (see Section 9.3)
   - If anesthetic-related: Give time to metabolize, support ventilation
5. If inadequate: Positive pressure ventilation, consider reintubation

### 9.3 Naloxone Use in Postoperative Period

**Naloxone: Opioid antagonist**

**Indications for naloxone:**
- Severe respiratory depression from opioid excess
- Respiratory rate <8 breaths/min with inadequate ventilation
- Unresponsive or minimally responsive patient with suspected opioid cause
- Apnea

**NOT indicated for:**
- Mild sedation with adequate ventilation
- Patient at baseline mental status (even if sedated, if breathing adequately)

**Dosing:**
- **Goal: Restore adequate ventilation, NOT eliminate all opioid effect**
- Dilute 0.4 mg naloxone in 10 mL saline (0.04 mg/mL)
- Give **0.04-0.08 mg IV** (1-2 mL) every 2-3 minutes
- Titrate to adequate respiratory rate and tidal volume
- Repeat as needed

**Avoid full reversal:**
- Full dose (0.4 mg bolus) causes:
  - Severe pain (all analgesia reversed)
  - Hypertension, tachycardia
  - Pulmonary edema (rare)
  - Agitation
- Use smallest dose to restore ventilation

**Monitoring after naloxone:**
- Naloxone duration of action: 30-60 minutes (shorter than most opioids)
- **Re-sedation can occur** as naloxone wears off
- **Continue monitoring minimum 2 hours** after last naloxone dose
- May need repeated doses or naloxone infusion if persistent problem

**Naloxone infusion (if needed):**
- Rare for rTKA
- If patient requires multiple boluses
- Typical: 0.04-0.08 mg/hr IV infusion (titrate to effect)

### 9.4 Reintubation in PACU

**Indications for reintubation:**
- Inability to maintain airway (obstruction despite interventions)
- Inadequate ventilation despite maximal support
- Persistent hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen and interventions
- Loss of consciousness with loss of airway reflexes
- Anticipated need for airway protection (bleeding, aspiration risk)
- Respiratory failure

**Reintubation procedure:**
- Similar to initial intubation
- **Pre-oxygenate** as much as possible (100% oxygen via bag-mask)
- Have emergency airway equipment ready
- Experienced operator
- Consider RSI technique if aspiration risk
- Video laryngoscopy reasonable first choice
- May be more difficult than initial intubation (edema, secretions, bleeding)

**Post-reintubation:**
- Mechanical ventilation
- Investigate cause of respiratory failure
- Likely requires ICU admission
- Inform surgical and primary teams
- Discuss with patient and family when appropriate

## 10. Special Populations

### 10.1 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

**OSA: Recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep**

**Significance for airway management:**
- Difficult mask ventilation more common
- May have difficult intubation (large tongue, pharyngeal tissue)
- Higher risk postoperative airway obstruction and respiratory depression
- Sensitive to sedatives an

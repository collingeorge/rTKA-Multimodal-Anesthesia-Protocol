# Multimodal & Opioid-Free Anesthesia Protocols for Robot-Assisted TKA (rTKA)
A unified, evidence-based set of anesthesia pathways and supporting clinical tools designed for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), integrating 2023–2025 literature, ERAS Society guidance, ASA/APSF safety recommendations, and ASRA 2024–2025 anticoagulation standards.

**These documents are educational and non-validated. They are not institutional policy and require attending anesthesiologist oversight for any real-world implementation.**

---

## Terminology
**Opioid-Free Anesthesia (OFA)** in this repository specifically refers to:

**Opioid-Free *Intraoperative* Anesthesia (OFIA)**

Opioid rescue **postoperatively** remains available when clinically required and **does not constitute pathway failure**.

# Directory Overview

This directory contains seven integrated components forming a complete anesthesia framework for rTKA:

1. **Three primary anesthesia pathways**  
2. **Pharmacology and dosing modules**  
3. **Adjunct and contraindication references**  
4. **A one-page protocol comparison table**  
5. **Quick-reference clinician cards** (printable)  
6. **PACU handoff templates** (in parent directories)  
7. **Complete evidence citations**

Each file is cross-referenced and consistent with the others.

## Protocol 1 — Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) With ACB + IPACK  
**File:** [`Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md`](Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**  
The ERAS-preferred pathway for rTKA. Combines quadriceps-sparing regional anesthesia (ACB + IPACK) with a multimodal OFIA strategy using **propofol-based induction and default propofol maintenance**, plus opioid-sparing adjuncts (e.g., ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium). **Sevoflurane may be added selectively** as an adjunct based on case length, complexity, or institutional workflow.

**Why it is preferred:**
- Lowest PONV incidence  
- Most reliable early ambulation (POD 0)  
- Superior analgesia (NRS 0–3 expected in PACU)  
- Motor-sparing block profile  

**Block Summary:**
- **ACB:** 20–30 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%  
- **IPACK:** 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%  
- Maximum safe ropivacaine dose: **~3 mg/kg (~210 mg for 70 kg patient)**

---

## Protocol 2 — OFIA Without Nerve Blocks (Block-Free Pathway)  
**File:** [`Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md`](Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**  
Used when blocks are **contraindicated** (ASRA anticoagulation timing) or **declined**.  
Relies on surgeon-delivered periarticular infiltration and a multimodal OFIA strategy with **propofol-based induction and default propofol maintenance**, plus opioid-sparing adjuncts as clinically appropriate. **Sevoflurane may be added selectively** depending on workflow and case characteristics.

**Why choose this pathway:**
- Fastest OR workflow (no block setup time)  
- Avoids anticoagulation safety conflicts  
- Preserves OFIA principles without regional techniques  

**Key Features:**
- Surgeon infiltration: **100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2%** (max dose ~3 mg/kg)
- Adjunct dosing is **selection-dependent** and should be reduced or omitted in hemodynamically fragile or frail patients
- If ketamine is used, it is treated as an **optional sub-anesthetic adjunct** (not a default induction agent)

---

## Protocol 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive General Anesthesia  
**File:** [`Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md`](Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md)

**Summary:**  
For chronic opioid users, severe anxiety, or contraindications to OFIA adjuncts.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Propofol is the default induction hypnotic** and **propofol TIVA is the default maintenance strategy** in this framework; **sevoflurane may be added selectively**
- Intraoperative fentanyl or hydromorphone supplementation
- Higher PONV and sedation risk  
- Slower emergence (10–20 minutes typical)  
- Requires enhanced postoperative respiratory monitoring  

---

# 2. Supporting Pharmacology & Dosing Modules

---

## Medication Dosing & Timing  
**File:** [`Protocol_Medication_Dosing_and_Timing.md`](Protocol_Medication_Dosing_and_Timing.md)

This module standardizes:

- Pre-operative oral agents  
- **Induction and maintenance dosing (propofol as default; sevoflurane optional/additive)**
- Adjunct infusion ranges (ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, lidocaine)  
- Onset/offset expectations  
- Emergence timing for each pathway  
- PACU rescue dosing logic  

It ensures all three protocols follow the same pharmacologic backbone.

---

## Adjuncts, Contraindications, and Safety  
**File:** [`Protocol_Adjuncts_and_Contraindications.md`](Protocol_Adjuncts_and_Contraindications.md)

Summarizes absolute/relative contraindications for:

- Ketamine (with patient-selection guardrails and BIS/EEG interpretation caveats)
- Dexmedetomidine  
- Magnesium sulfate (avoid if **CrCl <30 mL/min**)  
- Lidocaine infusion  
- Regional anesthesia (ACB/IPACK) per **ASRA 2024–2025**

Includes:
- LAST preparedness  
- QTc considerations  
- Cardiovascular safety reminders  
- Avoidance of gabapentinoids (ASA/APSF 2024)

---

# 3. Comparison and Quick-Reference Tools

---

## Pathway Comparison Table

# 4. Methodology

Protocols were created through systematic synthesis of:

### Society Guidelines
- **ERAS Society** hip and knee arthroplasty guidance (2019–2024 updates)  
- **ASRA 2024–2025** regional anesthesia and anticoagulation standards  
- **ASA/APSF 2023–2025** perioperative safety and opioid-sparing recommendations  

### Primary Evidence (2023–2025)
- RCTs evaluating ketamine, magnesium, dexmedetomidine for TKA  
- RCTs and meta-analyses on ACB and IPACK effectiveness  
- Comparative studies of OFA/OFIA vs opioid-based general anesthesia  
- PONV reduction strategies  
- Early mobility outcomes and ERAS compliance metrics  

### Evidence Level
Most recommendations represent **Level 1–2** evidence.

# 5. Protocol Selection Guide

## Use Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) when:
- Patient is opioid-naïve  
- Minimal PONV risk is desired  
- Early ambulation (POD 0) is prioritized  
- ASRA anticoagulation windows allow safe nerve blocks  
- Patient consents to regional anesthesia  

## Use Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) when:
- Anticoagulation timing makes ACB/IPACK unsafe  
- Patient declines blocks  
- OR efficiency is a priority  
- Surgeon comfortable with high-volume periarticular infiltration  
- OFIA strategy still desired  

## Use Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) when:
- Chronic opioid use or high opioid tolerance  
- Severe procedural anxiety  
- Contraindications to ketamine, dexmedetomidine, or magnesium  
- OSA requiring familiar, tightly titrated anesthetic workflow  
- Institutional or attending preference  

---

# 6. Clinical Implementation Notes

### Preconditions for Institutional Use
- Review medication formulary for ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, lidocaine  
- Confirm credentialing for ultrasound-guided ACB/IPACK  
- Educate PACU nurses on OFIA recovery patterns and ketamine rescue  
- Ensure **20% lipid emulsion** is immediately accessible for LAST  
- Pharmacy alignment on premixed adjunct infusions  

### Workflow Integration
- Blocks add **10–15 minutes** pre-incision  
- Block room can eliminate workflow delay  
- PACU handoff templates exist in parent folders  

### Quality Metrics (recommended for QI/IRB)
- Pain scores at PACU arrival, 2h, 12h, 24h  
- Total 24-h opioid consumption (MME)  
- PONV incidence and rescue  
- Time to ambulation and rehabilitation milestones  
- Length of stay (PACU + inpatient)  
- Patient satisfaction and functional recovery scores

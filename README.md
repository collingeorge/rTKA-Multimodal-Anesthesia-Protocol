# Multimodal Anesthesia Protocol for Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty

## Overview

This repository contains evidence-based anesthesia protocols for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), synthesized from 2023-2025 literature and designed to support opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) implementation within Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways.

## Three Standardized Pathways

1. Opioid-Free with Nerve Blocks (ACB + IPACK) - Preferred pathway
2. Opioid-Free without Nerve Blocks - Block-free alternative  
3. Conventional Opioid-Based - Traditional approach

Each pathway is optimized for patient safety, rapid recovery, and early mobilization while maintaining excellent analgesia.

## Background and Rationale

Traditional opioid-based anesthesia for total knee arthroplasty is associated with increased postoperative nausea and vomiting, delayed mobilization, respiratory depression risk, and prolonged hospital stay. Multimodal opioid-free anesthesia combined with quadriceps-sparing regional techniques offers superior analgesia with minimal motor block, same-day mobilization capability, reduced complications, and enhanced patient satisfaction.

Robot-assisted TKA presents unique anesthetic challenges including longer operative times requiring tourniquet tolerance, precise limb positioning requirements, and need for stable hemodynamics during robotic navigation. These protocols address these specific considerations while maintaining ERAS principles.

## Key Protocol Features

### Clinical Updates Incorporated (2024-2025 Evidence)

**Pharmacologic Modifications**

Removed from ERAS protocols:
- Gabapentin and pregabalin (associated with respiratory complications and delirium risk)

Added or optimized:
- Celecoxib 400 mg pre-operative loading dose
- Intravenous magnesium sulfate 30-50 mg/kg for improved analgesia
- Dexmedetomidine infusion-only approach to reduce bradycardia risk
- Ketamine infusion 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/hr for opioid-sparing effect
- Optional lidocaine infusion for block-free pathway

### Regional Anesthesia Techniques

**Adductor Canal Block**
- Volume: 20-30 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25%
- Quadriceps-sparing technique preserving knee extension strength
- Targets saphenous nerve and medial femoral cutaneous nerve
- Provides anterior and medial knee analgesia without motor weakness

**Infiltration between Popliteal Artery and Capsule of Knee (iPACK)**
- Volume: 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25%
- Targets posterior knee capsule innervation
- Provides posterior knee pain coverage
- Combined with ACB provides circumferential analgesia

### Safety and Quality Measures

- Compliance with ASRA 2024 anticoagulation guidelines for neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks
- Tourniquet time monitoring and management protocols
- Hemodynamic optimization strategies
- PACU pain rescue algorithms
- Delirium prevention approaches

## Pathway Comparison

| Feature | OFA + Blocks | OFA No Blocks | Conventional |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Analgesia Quality | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Motor Preservation | Excellent | Not applicable | Variable |
| PONV Risk | Minimal | Low | Moderate to High |
| Mobilization Timing | Same day | Same day | Delayed |
| Workflow Complexity | Moderate | Low | Low |
| Optimal Use Case | ERAS optimization | Block contraindications | Patient preference |

## Evidence Summary

This protocol synthesizes evidence from 16 primary sources including randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and updated society guidelines published between 2022 and 2024. All recommendations represent Level 1 or Level 2 evidence.

## Getting Started

1. Review 03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_Comparison_Table.md for pathway selection guidance
2. Use 01_PreOp_Checklist.md for pre-operative preparation and verification
3. Follow the appropriate protocol from 03_Anesthesia_Protocols directory
4. Reference 07_References_Evidence_2024.md for evidence supporting each recommendation

## Implementation Considerations

### Prerequisites for Institutional Adoption

Successful implementation of these protocols requires:
- Clinical validation with supervising anesthesiologists
- Multidisciplinary review involving anesthesia, surgery, nursing, and pharmacy
- Quality and safety committee approval
- Comprehensive staff education and training

# PACU Handoff Templates  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

Standardized PACU handoff language for the three primary rTKA anesthesia pathways:

1. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) + ACB/IPACK  
2. OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration only)  
3. Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia  

These scripts mirror the format used in the Counseling Script and Patient Communication materials.  
No shaded quote boxes are used; all emphasis is presented using **bold + italic** text to ensure readability in dark mode.

## 2. Handoff – Protocol 1: OFIA + ACB/IPACK

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient had opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia with functioning nerve blocks; expect low pain and minimal opioid needs.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty  
- No surgical complications

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 1: OFIA with ACB/IPACK**  
- General anesthesia or spinal + sedation  
- **No intraoperative opioids were administered**

### Regional Anesthesia
- **ACB:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20–30 mL  
- **IPACK:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20 mL  
- Total dose: [mg], below 3 mg/kg  
- Ultrasound-guided with negative aspiration and no paresthesia  
- Sensory coverage confirmed  
- Motor-sparing (quadriceps strength preserved)

### Intraoperative Course
- **Premed:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- **Induction:** propofol + ketamine (0.3–0.5 mg/kg) + rocuronium  
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC *or* propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min  
- **Adjuncts:** dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr; magnesium 30–50 mg/kg  
- Hemodynamics stable  
- EBL: [ ] mL  
- Fluids: [ ] mL  
- Urine output: [ ] mL  
- No arrhythmias, desaturation, or instability

### Analgesia Expectations
- Blocks last **12–18 hours**  
- Expected PACU pain: **mild (0–3/10)**  
- Scheduled: acetaminophen + NSAID  
- **If NRS ≥4:** assess block integrity, tourniquet pain, positioning pain  
- Follow rescue sequence (ketamine → minimal opioid if needed)

### Antiemetics
- Dexamethasone + ondansetron given  
- Scopolamine patch if high-risk  
- PONV risk: low  
- Additional antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- Airway: spontaneous respiration on [room air / NC]  
- Vitals stable  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: [alert / drowsy but arousable]  
- Motor: quad strength intact

### Anticipated Issues
- Dexmedetomidine residual effects (bradycardia, mild hypotension) possible  
- LAST risk extremely low but lipid emulsion accessible

### Orders / Plan
- Continue scheduled acetaminophen + NSAID  
- **Rescue:** ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3 doses)  
- Escalate to hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV only if inadequate  
- PACU discharge per protocol; **POD 0 ambulation expected**

## 3. Handoff – Protocol 2: OFIA, Block-Free

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient is opioid-free but did not receive nerve blocks. Expect moderate early pain. Ketamine is first-line rescue.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing rTKA  
- No complications

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 2: OFIA without blocks**  
- General anesthesia  
- **No intraoperative opioids used**

### Local Analgesia
- No ACB/IPACK performed due to:  
  - [Anticoagulation timing / patient refusal / workflow / anatomic considerations]  
- Surgeon performed large-volume periarticular infiltration:  
  - [Volume] mL of [concentration] local anesthetic

### Intraoperative Course
- Midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- Induction: propofol + ketamine 0.4–0.5 mg/kg  
- Maintenance: sevoflurane or propofol TIVA  
- Adjuncts: dexmedetomidine 0.3–0.7 mcg/kg/hr; magnesium 30–50 mg/kg; ± lidocaine infusion  
- Hemodynamics: [stable / required brief vasopressor]  
- EBL: [ ] mL; fluids: [ ] mL

### Analgesia Expectations
- Expected PACU pain: **moderate (3–6/10)**  
- Scheduled: acetaminophen + NSAID  
- **Rescue sequence:**  
  - First-line: ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3)  
  - Second-line: hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN  
- Pain may be higher early – expected, not a complication

### Antiemetics
- Dexamethasone + ondansetron given  
- PONV risk: moderate  
- Rescue antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- Airway: spontaneous on [room air / O₂]  
- Vitals stable  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: [ ]  
- Full motor function (no block effects)

### Anticipated Issues
- Higher pain than block pathway is expected  
- Monitor for dexmedetomidine-associated bradycardia/hypotension  
- Rare ketamine dysphoria

### Orders / Plan
- Continue multimodal analgesia  
- Ketamine first-line rescue  
- Opioids only if needed  
- Ice + elevation recommended  
- POD 0 ambulation expected

## 4. Handoff – Protocol 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient received intraoperative opioids. Expect more sedation and higher PONV and respiratory risk.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing rTKA

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 3: Opioid-inclusive**  
- Rationale: [Chronic opioid use / anxiety / contraindication to OFIA / patient preference]

### Analgesia Intra-op
- Premed: midazolam 1–2 mg  
- Multimodal baseline: acetaminophen + NSAID + dexamethasone  
- Opioids: fentanyl [ ] mcg, ± hydromorphone [ ] mg  
- Regional: [ACB/IPACK yes/no]

### Intraoperative Course
- Induction with propofol + opioids + rocuronium  
- Maintenance: sevoflurane + PRN opioid boluses  
- Hemodynamics: [ ]  
- EBL: [ ] mL; fluids: [ ] mL  
- Extubated uneventfully

### Analgesia Expectations
- If blocks performed: NRS ~0–3  
- If no blocks: NRS ~3–6  
- Opioid rescue expected in PACU

### Antiemetics
- Dex + ondansetron given  
- **Higher PONV risk** – treat proactively

### Current Status
- Airway: [extubated] with increased risk of respiratory depression  
- Vitals: HR [ ], BP [ ], RR [ ], SpO₂ [ ]%  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: typically deeper than OFIA pathways  
- OSA risk: [yes/no]

### Anticipated Issues
- Respiratory depression from opioids  
- Higher nausea risk  
- Delayed mobilization  
- Fall risk in elderly/frail patients

### Orders / Plan
- **Rescue opioid:** hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN NRS ≥4  
- Reassess after each dose  
- Continuous pulse oximetry; consider capnography  
- Naloxone available for RR <8 or SpO₂ <90%  
- Continue multimodal analgesia  
- PT and ambulation once alert/safe

---

## 5. Special Populations

### Elderly/Frail
- Increased delirium risk  
- Use minimal opioids and sedatives  
- Longer PACU observation may be appropriate

### OSA
- Prefer OFIA pathways  
- Continuous monitoring  
- Cautious opioid titration

### Chronic Opioid Users
- Document baseline MME  
- Opioid-inclusive pathway often required  
- Early Pain Service referral if needs are high

## 6. Integration and Local Adaptation

These templates should be adapted to local:

- Formulary  
- PACU staffing policies  
- Monitoring capabilities  
- EMR smart-phrase formats

# PACU Handoff Templates  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides standardized PACU handoff templates for the three primary anesthesia pathways used in rTKA:

1. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with ACB + IPACK  
2. OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration only)  
3. Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia  

These templates are designed for verbal handoff and can be adapted into EMR smart phrases.

## 2. Handoff – Pathway 1: OFIA + ACB/IPACK

**PACU Nurse: This patient is on an opioid-sparing pathway**

### Patient / Procedure
[Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty, completed without complications.

### Anesthesia / Pathway
Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia with general anesthesia [or spinal anesthesia with sedation] and ultrasound-guided adductor canal block plus IPACK. **No intraoperative opioids were administered.**

### Regional Anesthesia Details
- **ACB:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20–30 mL  
- **IPACK:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20 mL  
- **Total ropivacaine dose:** [mg]
- Blocks performed preoperatively under ultrasound guidance with negative aspiration and no intravascular injection
- No paresthesias or complications during placement
- Sensory coverage confirmed: [dermatomes]
- Motor function preserved (quad-sparing confirmed)

### Intraoperative Course
**Hemodynamically stable throughout.**

- **Premedication:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV for anxiolysis
- **Induction:** propofol + low-dose ketamine (0.3–0.5 mg/kg) + rocuronium  
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC [or propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min]
- **Adjuncts:** dexmedetomidine infusion (0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr), magnesium sulfate (30–50 mg/kg)
- **Estimated blood loss:** [value]  
- **Fluids:** [total crystalloid volume]
- **Urine output:** [value]
- No significant arrhythmias, ischemia, or desaturation episodes

### Analgesia / Pain Expectations
Multimodal regimen with functioning ACB/IPACK blocks **expected to last 12–18 hours.**

- **Expected pain:** mild (0–3/10) in PACU  
- **If NRS ≥4:** consider tourniquet discomfort, incomplete block, or positioning pain and follow PACU rescue algorithm  
- **Scheduled medications:** acetaminophen 1 g q6h + [celecoxib/ketorolac/meloxicam]

### Antiemetics / PONV
- Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV intra-op  
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence  
- [Scopolamine patch applied preoperatively if high PONV risk]
- **PONV risk:** moderate–low; treat nausea per standard protocol if needed

### Current Status
- **Airway:** breathing spontaneously on room air / nasal cannula [specify O₂ flow]
- **Vitals:** HR [value], BP [value], RR [value], SpO₂ [value]% - stable  
- **Pain score on arrival:** [0–10]  
- **Sedation:** responsive to voice / drowsy but arousable [RASS score if applicable]
- **Motor function:** quad strength intact bilaterally, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion present

### Anticipated Issues
- Monitor for **bradycardia (HR <50)** or **hypotension** related to residual dexmedetomidine
- **Treatment:** glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV preferred over atropine
- **Lipid emulsion 20%** available for LAST (rare but keep accessible)

### Orders / Plan
- Continue scheduled acetaminophen and NSAID per ERAS pathway  
- **Rescue analgesia:** ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min for breakthrough pain (max 3 doses), then low-dose opioid (hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV) only if inadequate  
- Standard discharge criteria from PACU; **ambulation anticipated on POD 0** (typically 4–6 hours post-op)
- Urinary catheter [present/absent]; remove per protocol
- VTE prophylaxis: [per surgeon preference and anticoagulation plan]

## 3. Handoff – Pathway 2: OFIA, Block-Free

**PACU Nurse: This patient is on an opioid-sparing pathway**

### Patient / Procedure
[Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty, completed without complications.

### Anesthesia / Pathway
Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia without peripheral nerve blocks. Analgesia relies on multimodal systemic medications plus surgeon periarticular local anesthetic infiltration. **No intraoperative opioids were administered.**

### Regional / Local Analgesia
- **No ACB/IPACK performed.** Reason: [anticoagulation timing / patient refusal / workflow preference / anatomical difficulty]
- Surgeon performed large-volume periarticular local anesthetic infiltration ([volume] mL of [concentration] ropivacaine/bupivacaine) prior to closure

### Intraoperative Course
- **Premedication:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV for anxiolysis
- **Induction:** propofol + higher-dose ketamine (0.4–0.5 mg/kg)
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC [or propofol TIVA]
- **Adjuncts:** dexmedetomidine infusion (0.3–0.7 mcg/kg/hr), magnesium sulfate (30–50 mg/kg), [± lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr]
- **Hemodynamics:** [brief summary - stable/required vasopressors/etc]
- **Estimated blood loss:** [value]  
- **Fluids:** [total volume]
- No major intraoperative events

### Analgesia / Pain Expectations
**Expected PACU pain scores:** moderate (3–6/10), especially with movement during first 12–24 hours due to absence of nerve blocks.

- Patient counseled preoperatively about higher early pain expectations
- **Baseline multimodal meds ordered:** acetaminophen 1 g q6h + NSAID  
- **Primary rescue:** ketamine bolus 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3 doses)  
- **Opioid rescue:** hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min only if non-opioid measures insufficient

### Antiemetics / PONV
- Dexamethasone 8–10 mg + ondansetron 4 mg given intra-op
- **PONV risk:** moderate; treat per protocol with additional ondansetron or alternative antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- **Airway:** breathing spontaneously [room air/O₂ supplement]
- **Vitals:** HR [value], BP [value], RR [value], SpO₂ [value]%
- **Pain score on arrival:** [0–10]; patient reminded pain may be higher due to no blocks but will improve with multimodal regimen
- **Sedation:** [responsive to voice / drowsy but arousable]
- **Motor function:** full quad strength, ankle movement intact

### Anticipated Issues
- **Higher pain scores expected** - this is normal for block-free pathway
- Monitor for residual dexmedetomidine effects (bradycardia, hypotension)
- Psychotomimetic side effects from ketamine possible but rare at rescue doses

### Orders / Plan
- Continue scheduled multimodal analgesia  
- Follow PACU rescue algorithm with **ketamine first-line, opioids second-line**
- Ice application and positioning for comfort
- Standard discharge criteria; **early PT and ambulation important** (typically POD 0)
- Monitor for LAST (rare but possible with surgeon's infiltration)

## 4. Handoff – Pathway 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive

### Patient / Procedure
[Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Procedure completed without complications.

### Anesthesia / Pathway
Conventional general anesthesia with intraoperative opioids. This pathway was selected due to [chronic opioid use (baseline [X] MME/day) / severe anxiety / contraindication to OFIA agents / patient preference / attending judgment].

### Analgesia Intra-op
- **Multimodal:** acetaminophen 1 g, celecoxib 400 mg (or other NSAID), dexamethasone 8–10 mg  
- **Premedication:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV
- **Opioids:** fentanyl [total mcg] and/or hydromorphone [total mg] intra-op  
- **Regional:** [ACB/IPACK performed with ropivacaine [volumes] vs no blocks - reason: [X]]

### Intraoperative Course
- **Induction:** midazolam + propofol + fentanyl/hydromorphone + rocuronium
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC + fentanyl boluses PRN
- **Hemodynamics:** [stable / required vasopressors / brief hypotension]
- **Airway:** [ETT / LMA] size [X], no major airway complications  
- **Estimated blood loss:** [value]  
- **Fluids:** [total volume]

### Analgesia / Pain Expectations
Pain and sedation may vary due to intraoperative opioid use.

- Baseline multimodal meds in place  
- Opioid rescue in PACU anticipated and expected
- **If blocks performed:** expect lower pain scores (NRS 0–3)
- **If no blocks:** expect moderate pain (NRS 3–6)

### Antiemetics / PONV
- Dexamethasone 8–10 mg + ondansetron 4 mg given intra-op
- **PONV risk higher** than OFIA pathways due to opioid exposure
- Anticipate need for rescue antiemetics (ondansetron q6h PRN, consider promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg)

### Current Status
- **Airway:** [extubated / breathing spontaneously], **monitor closely due to opioid exposure**
- **Vitals:** HR [value], BP [value], RR [value], SpO₂ [value]%
- **Pain:** NRS [0–10]  
- **Sedation:** [e.g., RASS score or "drowsy but arousable" / "alert and oriented"]
- **Motor function:** quadriceps strength [intact / testing pending], ankle movement [present/absent]

### Anticipated Issues
- **Respiratory depression risk** due to opioid exposure - monitor RR and SpO₂ closely
- **Higher PONV risk** - treat proactively
- Sedation may delay mobilization
- **OSA patients require enhanced monitoring**

### Orders / Plan
- PACU opioid rescue: **hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN** for NRS ≥4, titrated carefully with reassessment after each dose
- Maintain **oxygen saturation >92%**; consider capnography if available for high-risk patients
- **Naloxone 0.4 mg IV available** per institutional policy for respiratory depression (RR <10, SpO₂ <90%)
- Continue multimodal non-opioid regimen postoperatively (acetaminophen + NSAID scheduled)
- Standard PACU discharge criteria; ambulation when alert and pain controlled
- **Enhanced monitoring if OSA, elderly, or frail**

## 5. Special Considerations for All Pathways

### Elderly/Frail Patients
- Emphasize delirium risk and prevention strategies
- Reduced medication doses used intraoperatively
- May require extended PACU monitoring
- Fall precautions essential

### OSA Patients
- Enhanced respiratory monitoring required
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Consider capnography
- Avoid oversedation
- Earlier mobilization preferred

### Anticoagulation Considerations
- Document timing of last anticoagulant dose
- VTE prophylaxis plan per surgeon and patient risk factors
- If blocks performed, note ASRA guidelines followed

## 6. Adaptation and Local Use

These templates are intentionally generic and must be:

- Adjusted to local medication formularies and dosing policies  
- Integrated with institutional pain and PONV protocols  
- Reviewed by supervising anesthesiologists and PACU leadership  
- Modified to match EMR capabilities and smart phrase formats
- Adapted for verbal vs written handoff preferences

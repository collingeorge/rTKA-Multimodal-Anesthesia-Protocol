# PACU Handoff Templates  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides standardized PACU handoff templates for the three primary anesthesia pathways used in rTKA:

1. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with ACB + IPACK  
2. OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration only)  
3. Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia  

These templates are designed for verbal handoff and can be adapted into EMR smart phrases.

## 1. General Handoff Structure (All Pathways)

**Suggested structure:**

1. Patient identifiers and procedure  
2. Anesthesia type and pathway  
3. Intraoperative course (hemodynamics, events)  
4. Analgesia strategy and expectations  
5. Antiemetic strategy and PONV risk  
6. Current status (vitals, airway, pain, sedation)  
7. Anticipated problems and rescue plans  
8. Disposition plan and key orders

## 2. Handoff – Pathway 1: OFIA + ACB/IPACK

**PACU Nurse: This patient is on an opioid-sparing pathway**

**Template:**

> **Patient / Procedure**  
> 64-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty, completed without complications.  
>  
> **Anesthesia / Pathway**  
> Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia with general anesthesia and ultrasound-guided adductor canal block plus IPACK. No intraoperative opioids were administered.  
>  
> **Regional Anesthesia Details**  
> - ACB: ropivacaine 0.2–0.25 %, 20–30 mL  
> - IPACK: ropivacaine 0.2–0.25 %, 20 mL  
> Blocks performed preoperatively under ultrasound guidance with negative aspiration and no intravascular injection. No paresthesias or complications during placement.  
>  
> **Intraoperative Course**  
> Hemodynamically stable throughout.  
> - Induction: propofol + low-dose ketamine + rocuronium  
> - Adjuncts: dexmedetomidine infusion, magnesium sulfate infusion  
> - Estimated blood loss: [value]  
> - No significant arrhythmias, ischemia, or desaturation episodes.  
>  
> **Analgesia / Pain Expectations**  
> Multimodal regimen with functioning ACB/IPACK.  
> - Expected pain: mild (0–3/10) in PACU  
> - If NRS ≥4, consider tourniquet discomfort or incomplete block and follow PACU rescue algorithm.  
>  
> **Antiemetics / PONV**  
> - Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV intra-op  
> - Ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence  
> PONV risk is moderate–low; treat nausea per standard protocol.  
>  
> **Current Status**  
> - Airway: breathing spontaneously on room air / nasal cannula [specify]  
> - Vitals: [HR, BP, RR, SpO₂] stable  
> - Pain score on arrival: [0–10]  
> - Sedation: responsive to voice / drowsy but arousable  
>  
> **Orders / Plan**  
> - Continue scheduled acetaminophen and NSAID per ERAS pathway  
> - Use ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min for breakthrough pain (max 3 doses), then low-dose opioid only if inadequate  
> - Monitor for bradycardia or hypotension related to residual dexmedetomidine  
> - Standard discharge criteria from PACU; ambulation anticipated on POD 0

## 3. Handoff – Pathway 2: OFIA, Block-Free

**PACU Nurse: This patient is on an opioid-sparing pathway**

**Template:**

> **Patient / Procedure**  
> [Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty, completed without complications.  
>  
> **Anesthesia / Pathway**  
> Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia without peripheral nerve blocks. Analgesia relies on multimodal systemic medications plus surgeon periarticular local anesthetic infiltration. No intraoperative opioids were administered.  
>  
> **Regional / Local Analgesia**  
> - No ACB/IPACK performed. Reason: [anticoagulation timing / patient refusal / workflow].  
> - Surgeon performed large-volume periarticular local anesthetic infiltration prior to closure.  
>  
> **Intraoperative Course**  
> - Induction: propofol + higher-dose ketamine  
> - Adjuncts: dexmedetomidine infusion, magnesium sulfate ± lidocaine infusion  
> - Hemodynamics: [brief summary]  
> - Estimated blood loss: [value]  
> No major intraoperative events.  
>  
> **Analgesia / Pain Expectations**  
> Expected PACU pain scores: moderate (3–6/10), especially with movement during first 12–24 hours.  
> - Baseline multimodal meds ordered (acetaminophen + NSAID)  
> - Primary rescue: ketamine bolus 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3 doses)  
> - Opioid rescue only if non-opioid measures insufficient  
>  
> **Antiemetics / PONV**  
> Dexamethasone + ondansetron given intra-op.  
> PONV risk moderate; treat per protocol.  
>  
> **Current Status**  
> - Airway: [status]  
> - Vitals: [HR, BP, RR, SpO₂]  
> - Pain score on arrival: [0–10]; patient informed pain may be higher due to no blocks.  
> - Sedation: [description]  
>  
> **Orders / Plan**  
> - Continue scheduled multimodal analgesia  
> - Follow PACU rescue algorithm with ketamine first-line, opioids second-line  
> - Monitor for psychotomimetic side effects from ketamine (rare at rescue doses)  
> - Standard discharge criteria; early PT and ambulation important

## 4. Handoff – Pathway 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive

**Template:**

> **Patient / Procedure**  
> [Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Procedure completed without complications.  
>  
> **Anesthesia / Pathway**  
> Conventional general anesthesia with intraoperative opioids. This pathway was selected due to [chronic opioid use / severe anxiety / contraindication to OFIA agents / attending preference].  
>  
> **Analgesia Intra-op**  
> - Multimodal: acetaminophen, celecoxib (or other NSAID), dexamethasone  
> - Opioids: fentanyl [total mcg] and/or hydromorphone [total mg] intra-op  
> - Regional: [ACB/IPACK performed vs no blocks]  
>  
> **Intraoperative Course**  
> - Hemodynamics: [brief summary]  
> - Airway: [ETT / LMA] with no major airway complications  
> - Estimated blood loss: [value]  
>  
> **Analgesia / Pain Expectations**  
> Pain and sedation may vary due to opioid use.  
> - Baseline multimodal meds in place  
> - Opioid rescue in PACU expected may be required  
>  
> **Antiemetics / PONV**  
> Dexamethasone + ondansetron given intra-op.  
> PONV risk higher than OFIA pathways; anticipate need for rescue antiemetics.  
>  
> **Current Status**  
> - Motor function: quadriceps strength [intact / testing pending]
> - Airway: [status], monitor closely due to opioid exposure  
> - Vitals: [HR, BP, RR, SpO₂]  
> - Pain: NRS [0–10]  
> - Sedation: [e.g., RASS or simple descriptive scale]  
>  
> **Orders / Plan**  
> - PACU opioid rescue: hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN for NRS ≥4, titrated carefully  
> - Maintain oxygen saturation and monitor for respiratory depression  
> - Naloxone available per institutional policy  
> - Continue multimodal non-opioid regimen postoperatively

## 5. Adaptation and Local Use

These templates are intentionally generic and must be:

- Adjusted to local medication formularies and dosing policies  
- Integrated with institutional pain and PONV protocols  
- Reviewed by supervising anesthesiologists and PACU leadership

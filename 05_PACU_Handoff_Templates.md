# PACU Handoff Templates  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

Standardized PACU handoff language for the three primary rTKA anesthesia pathways:

1. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) + ACB/IPACK**  
2. **OFIA – Block-Free** (surgeon periarticular infiltration only)  
3. **Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia**  

These scripts mirror the format used in the Counseling Script and Patient Communication materials.  
No shaded quote boxes are used; all emphasis is presented using **bold + italic** text to ensure readability in dark mode.

**Scope note:** This repository is **GA/TIVA-centric**. Neuraxial technique selection is addressed in the dedicated decision document and is not standardized in these handoff scripts.

## 2. Handoff – Protocol 1: OFIA + ACB/IPACK

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient had opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia with functioning nerve blocks; expect low pain and minimal opioid needs.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty  
- No surgical complications

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 1: OFIA with ACB/IPACK**  
- General anesthesia (volatile or TIVA)  
- **No intraoperative opioids were administered**

### Regional Anesthesia
- **ACB:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20–30 mL  
- **IPACK:** ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%, 20 mL  
- Total dose: [mg] (**≤3 mg/kg**)  
- Ultrasound-guided; negative aspiration; no paresthesia  
- Sensory coverage confirmed  
- Motor-sparing (quadriceps strength preserved)  
- **20% lipid emulsion immediately available** (LAST preparedness)

### Intraoperative Course
- **Premed:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- **Induction:** propofol + ketamine (0.3–0.5 mg/kg) + rocuronium  
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC *or* propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min  
- **Adjuncts:** dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr; magnesium 30–50 mg/kg  
- Hemodynamics stable  
- EBL: [ ] mL  
- Fluids: [ ] mL  
- Urine output: [ ] mL  
- No arrhythmias, desaturation, or instability

### Analgesia Expectations
- Blocks last **12–18 hours**  
- Expected PACU pain: **mild (0–3/10)**  
- Scheduled: acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor (per orders)  
- **If NRS ≥4:** assess block integrity, tourniquet pain, positioning pain  
- Follow rescue sequence (**ketamine first-line → minimal opioid only if needed**)

### Antiemetics
- Dexamethasone + ondansetron given  
- Scopolamine patch if high-risk  
- PONV risk: **low–moderate depending on Apfel score**; prophylaxis given  
- Additional antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- Airway: spontaneous respiration on [room air / NC]  
- Vitals stable  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: [alert / drowsy but easily arousable]  
- Motor: quadriceps strength intact

### Anticipated Issues
- Dexmedetomidine residual effects (bradycardia, mild hypotension) possible  
- LAST risk low; lipid emulsion accessible

### Orders / Plan
- Continue scheduled acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor  
- **Rescue (first-line):** ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3 doses)  
- **If opioid required:** hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV** q10–15 min PRN  
  - **High-risk (elderly/frail/OSA): start 0.1 mg IV increments**  
  - Reassess pain, sedation, RR, SpO₂ after each dose  
- PACU discharge per protocol; **POD 0 ambulation expected**

## 3. Handoff – Protocol 2: OFIA, Block-Free

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient is opioid-free but did not receive nerve blocks. Expect moderate early pain. Ketamine is first-line rescue.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing rTKA  
- No complications

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 2: OFIA without blocks**  
- General anesthesia  
- **No intraoperative opioids used**

### Local Analgesia
- No ACB/IPACK performed due to:  
  - [Anticoagulation timing / patient refusal / workflow / anatomic considerations]  
- Surgeon performed periarticular infiltration:  
  - [Volume] mL of [concentration] local anesthetic (dose per surgeon protocol)

### Intraoperative Course
- **Premed:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- **Induction:** propofol + ketamine 0.4–0.5 mg/kg  
- **Maintenance:** sevoflurane *or* propofol TIVA  
- **Adjuncts:** dexmedetomidine 0.3–0.7 mcg/kg/hr; magnesium 30–50 mg/kg; ± lidocaine infusion (per protocol)  
- Hemodynamics: [stable / required brief vasopressor]  
- EBL: [ ] mL  
- Fluids: [ ] mL

### Analgesia Expectations
- Expected PACU pain: **moderate (3–6/10)**  
- Scheduled: acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor (per orders)  
- **Rescue sequence:**  
  - **First-line:** ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min (max 3 doses)  
  - **Second-line (if needed):** hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV** q10–15 min PRN  
    - **High-risk (elderly/frail/OSA): start 0.1 mg IV increments**  
    - Reassess pain, sedation, RR, SpO₂ after each dose  
- Higher pain than block pathway is expected early and does not imply a complication in isolation

### Antiemetics
- Dexamethasone + ondansetron given  
- PONV risk: **moderate**; rescue antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- Airway: spontaneous on [room air / O₂]  
- Vitals stable  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: [ ]  
- Full motor function (no block effects)

### Anticipated Issues
- Higher pain than block pathway is expected  
- Dexmedetomidine-associated bradycardia/hypotension possible  
- Rare ketamine dysphoria

### Orders / Plan
- Continue multimodal analgesia  
- Ketamine first-line rescue  
- Opioids only if needed (use high-risk titration when applicable)  
- Ice + elevation recommended  
- POD 0 ambulation expected

## 4. Handoff – Protocol 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive

**_Nurse-facing note: “This patient received intraoperative opioids. Expect more sedation and higher PONV and respiratory risk.”_**

### Patient / Procedure
- [Age]-year-old undergoing rTKA

### Anesthesia / Pathway
- **Protocol 3: Opioid-inclusive**  
- Rationale: [Chronic opioid use / severe anxiety / contraindication to OFIA / patient preference]

### Analgesia Intra-op
- **Premed:** midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- Multimodal baseline: acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor + dexamethasone  
- Opioids: fentanyl [ ] mcg, ± hydromorphone [ ] mg  
- Regional: [ACB/IPACK yes/no]

### Intraoperative Course
- Induction: propofol + opioid + rocuronium  
- Maintenance: sevoflurane *or* propofol TIVA with PRN opioid boluses  
- Hemodynamics: [ ]  
- EBL: [ ] mL  
- Fluids: [ ] mL  
- Extubated uneventfully

### Analgesia Expectations
- If blocks performed: expected PACU NRS ~0–3  
- If no blocks: expected PACU NRS ~3–6  
- Opioid rescue may be required in PACU

### Antiemetics
- Dexamethasone + ondansetron given  
- **Higher PONV risk** — treat proactively; rescue antiemetics PRN

### Current Status
- Airway: extubated; increased risk of opioid-related respiratory depression  
- Vitals: HR [ ], BP [ ], RR [ ], SpO₂ [ ]%  
- Pain: NRS [ ]  
- Sedation: may be deeper than OFIA pathways  
- OSA risk: [yes/no]

### Anticipated Issues
- Respiratory depression from opioids  
- Higher nausea risk  
- Delayed mobilization  
- Fall risk in elderly/frail patients

### Orders / Plan
- **Rescue opioid:** hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV** q10–15 min PRN for NRS ≥4  
  - **High-risk (elderly/frail/OSA): start 0.1 mg IV increments**  
  - Reassess pain, sedation, RR, SpO₂ after each dose  
- Continuous pulse oximetry; consider capnography for high-risk patients  
- Naloxone available for clinically significant respiratory depression (per institutional protocol)  
- Continue multimodal analgesia  
- PT/ambulation once alert and safe

---

## 5. Special Populations (PACU Emphasis)

### Elderly / Frail
- Increased delirium and fall risk  
- Use minimal opioids and sedatives; prefer ketamine-first rescue when appropriate  
- Longer PACU observation may be appropriate

### OSA / Respiratory Disease
- Prefer OFIA pathways when appropriate  
- Continuous monitoring; cautious opioid titration  
- Consider capnography based on institutional policy and risk profile

### Chronic Opioid Users
- Document baseline MME  
- Opioid-inclusive pathway often required  
- Consider early Acute Pain Service involvement if escalating requirements

## 6. Integration and Local Adaptation

These templates should be adapted to local:

- Formulary  
- PACU staffing policies  
- Monitoring capabilities  
- EMR smart-phrase formats

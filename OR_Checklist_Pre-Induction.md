# Anesthesia OR Readiness & Safety Checklist
**Evidence-Informed, Clinically Reviewed Pre-Case OR Setup Guide**
**Version 1.4 — December 2025**

---

## Purpose
A standardized, reproducible pre-case anesthesia preparation workflow ensuring equipment integrity, medication readiness, regional block safety, crisis preparedness, and optimal communication prior to patient arrival.
**Designed for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) multimodal anesthesia pathways**, but applicable to most major orthopedic cases.

# III. Medication Setup (Safety-Verified)

## 7. Induction Medications (Drawn & Labeled)

### Standard Induction (all pathways)
- ✓ **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** (anxiolysis; use 0.5–1 mg in elderly/OSA/frail)
- ✓ **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (consider 1–1.5 mg/kg in frail/cardiac)
- ✓ **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** (dose/interval guided by TOF)

### Ketamine (selection-dependent; hemodynamic-aware)
- ✓ **Ketamine 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (OFIA favored)
  - Typical **0.3–0.5 mg/kg** in robust physiology
  - Typical **0.2–0.3 mg/kg** in elderly/frail/cardiac risk or catecholamine-depleted states

### OFIA Pathways (1 & 2) – Adjunct readiness
- ✓ Dexmedetomidine: optional slow load **0.5 mcg/kg over 10–20 min** → infusion per pathway range
- ✓ Magnesium sulfate: **30–50 mg/kg over 15–20 min** (avoid if CrCl <30 mL/min)
- ✓ Ketamine infusion: **0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr** (pathway-dependent)
- ✓ Lidocaine infusion (Pathway 2 optional): **1–2 mg/kg/hr** (max ~300 mg total; apply contraindications)

### Conventional Opioid-Based Pathway (3)
- ✓ Fentanyl **1–2 mcg/kg** or hydromorphone **0.2–0.4 mg** (titrated)

## 8. Emergency Drugs (Immediate Access)
- ✓ Epinephrine 10 mcg/mL (push-dose) + 1 mg vial
- ✓ Phenylephrine 100 mcg/mL
- ✓ Ephedrine 5–10 mg/mL
- ✓ **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** (preferred for dex-related bradycardia patterns)
- ✓ Atropine available per institutional practice
- ✓ Naloxone available (opioid pathways / rescue)

## 9. Adjuvant / Maintenance Medications

### Preoperative (Verify Given or Available)
- ✓ Acetaminophen 1 g PO
- ✓ Celecoxib 400 mg PO (or alternative NSAID)
- ✓ Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV
- ✓ Scopolamine patch (high PONV risk only)

### Intraoperative
- ✓ Ondansetron 4 mg IV
- ✓ Antibiotics timed correctly (cefazolin 2 g or alternative)

### Neuromuscular reversal
- ✓ **Sugammadex available:** **2 mg/kg** (TOF ≥2), **4 mg/kg** (deep block), **16 mg/kg** (immediate reversal contingency)

### Maintenance options (repository-standard)
- ✓ **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min (default)**
- ✓ ± Sevoflurane **0.8–1.2 MAC** (optional; hybrid/transition/institutional preference)

**All syringes labeled** with medication, concentration, date/time, and initials.

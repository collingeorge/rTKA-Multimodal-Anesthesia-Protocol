# Anesthesia OR Readiness & Safety Checklist  
**Evidence-Informed, Clinically Reviewed Pre-Case OR Setup Guide**  
**Designed for rTKA Multimodal Anesthesia (OFIA-First), Applicable to Major Orthopedics**

---

## Purpose
A standardized, reproducible pre-case anesthesia preparation workflow ensuring:

- Equipment integrity
- Medication readiness
- Regional anesthesia safety
- Crisis preparedness
- Clear team communication  

This checklist supports **robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA)** anesthesia pathways and reflects **ERAS-aligned, opioid-minimizing practice**, but is broadly applicable to major orthopedic cases.

---

- ✓ Room temperature appropriate (68–72°F)
- ✓ Table positioned, locked, safety straps present
- ✓ Forced-air warming device available and functional
- ✓ Suction on and tested (Yankauer attached)
- ✓ Overhead lights functional
- ✓ Waste and sharps containers present and not overfilled
- ✓ Robotic system positioned appropriately (if rTKA)

---

## 2. Anesthesia Machine (ASA / APSF Checkout)
- ✓ Automated self-test completed
- ✓ Verify:
  - Circuit integrity (leak test)
  - APL valve function
  - Reservoir bag integrity
  - **Two oxygen sources:** pipeline + full E-cylinder (≥1800–2200 psi)
  - CO₂ absorber fresh
  - Face mask seal confirmed
- ✓ Vaporizer filled/locked **if volatile planned**
- ✓ Fresh gas flows confirmed (2–4 L/min)

---

## 3. Airway Equipment
- ✓ Laryngoscope handle with working batteries
- ✓ Blades: Mac 3–4; Miller available as needed
- ✓ Video laryngoscope tested
- ✓ Oral and nasal airways (all sizes)
- ✓ ETTs: primary + one size up/down (7.0–8.0 mm typical adult)
- ✓ LMA / i-Gel sizes 4–5
- ✓ Stylet, bougie, tube exchanger
- ✓ Syringe for cuff inflation
- ✓ ETCO₂ line tested
- ✓ Difficult airway cart location verified

---

# II. IV Access, Fluids & Blood Preparation

## 4. IV Access
- ✓ Primary IV placed and flushed (18G preferred for rTKA)
- ✓ Second IV available if high-risk
- ✓ Pressure bags tested
- ✓ Extension tubing available

---

## 5. Fluids
- ✓ Balanced crystalloid (LR or Plasma-Lyte) spiked and ready
- ✓ Additional fluids staged if indicated:
  - Colloid (institution-specific)
  - Blood products
  - Rapid infuser for high-risk cases

---

## 6. Blood & Laboratory Review
- ✓ Type & Screen / Crossmatch verified
- ✓ Blood units available if required
- ✓ Critical labs reviewed:
  - Hemoglobin / hematocrit
  - Electrolytes
  - **Creatinine** (DOAC clearance; magnesium dosing)
  - Glucose (diabetics)
  - **INR reviewed** if neuraxial or blocks planned
- ✓ Pregnancy test completed if applicable

---

# III. Medication Setup (Safety-Verified)

## 7. Induction Medications (Drawn & Labeled)

### Standard Induction (All Pathways)
- ✓ **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV**  
  *(0.5–1 mg in elderly / OSA / frail patients)*
- ✓ **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV**  
  *(1–1.5 mg/kg in frail or cardiac patients)*
- ✓ **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
  *(TOF-guided)*

---

### Ketamine (OFIA-Preferred)
- ✓ **Ketamine 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV**
  - 0.3–0.5 mg/kg: robust physiology
  - 0.2–0.3 mg/kg: elderly, frail, or catecholamine-depleted states

---

## 8. OFIA Adjuncts (Pathways 1 & 2)

- ✓ **Dexmedetomidine**
  - Optional slow load: **0.5 mcg/kg over 10–20 min**
  - Infusion: **0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr**
  - Avoid loading dose in high-risk patients

- ✓ **Magnesium sulfate**
  - **30–50 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min**
  - Avoid if CrCl <30 mL/min

- ✓ **Ketamine infusion**
  - **0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr**

- ✓ **Lidocaine infusion (Adjunct Only)**
  - **1–2 mg/kg/hr IV**
  - **Initiate only after induction**
  - **Never used as monotherapy**
  - Used **only in conjunction with ketamine-based OFIA**
  - Rationale:
    - Low pH → infusion discomfort if inadequately anesthetized
    - Modest analgesia; synergistic benefit only
  - Screen contraindications; monitor for toxicity
  - Do not exceed institutional cumulative dose limits (~300 mg typical)

---

## 9. Conventional Opioid Pathway (Pathway 3)
- ✓ **Fentanyl infusion** (preferred over bolus-only strategy)
  - Typical range: **0.5–2 mcg/kg/hr**
  - Adjust for age, frailty, and respiratory risk
- ✓ Hydromorphone reserved for rescue or institutional preference

---

## 10. Emergency Drugs (Immediate Access)
- ✓ Epinephrine (10 mcg/mL push-dose + 1 mg vial)
- ✓ Phenylephrine 100 mcg/mL
- ✓ Ephedrine 5–10 mg/mL
- ✓ **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** (preferred for dex-related bradycardia)
- ✓ Atropine available per institutional practice
- ✓ Naloxone available

---

## 11. Maintenance & Reversal
- ✓ **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (default)
- ✓ ± Sevoflurane **0.8–1.2 MAC** (optional / hybrid)
- ✓ **Sugammadex available**
  - 2 mg/kg (TOF ≥2)
  - 4 mg/kg (deep block)

**All syringes labeled** (drug, concentration, date/time, initials).

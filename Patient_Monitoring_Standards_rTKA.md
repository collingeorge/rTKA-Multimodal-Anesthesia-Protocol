## 1. ASA Standard Monitors (Mandatory - All Protocols)

### 1.1 Continuous Monitors

**Required for all phases of general anesthesia from induction through emergence:**

| Monitor | Requirement | Display | Alarms | Clinical Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Pulse Oximetry (SpO₂)** | Mandatory continuous | Numeric value and plethysmographic waveform | Enabled with appropriate thresholds | Detect hypoxemia; assess peripheral perfusion |
| **Capnography (EtCO₂)** | Mandatory continuous during controlled ventilation | Numeric value and waveform | Enabled with appropriate thresholds | Confirm ventilation; detect disconnection, apnea, circuit problems; assess metabolic status |
| **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** | Mandatory continuous | Continuous display of rhythm and rate | Rate and rhythm alarms enabled | Detect arrhythmias, ischemia, and conduction abnormalities |
| **Breathing System Pressure** | Mandatory when using mechanical ventilation | Pressure display with high and low alarms | Disconnect alarm mandatory | Detect disconnection, obstruction, and ventilator malfunction |
| **Inspired Oxygen (FiO₂)** | Mandatory continuous | Numeric display in breathing circuit | Low oxygen alarm enabled | Ensure adequate oxygen delivery; detect hypoxic mixtures |

**Additional continuous monitoring considerations:**

| Monitor | Indication | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy/Other)** | Consider for elderly, high-risk cardiac, TIVA, or when depth assessment needed | See Section 4 for detailed guidance |
| **Arterial Blood Pressure (Invasive)** | Severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability, need for frequent blood gases | See Section 5 for detailed indications |
| **Central Venous Pressure** | Rarely needed for routine rTKA; severe cardiac disease requiring vasoactive infusions | See Section 5 for detailed indications |

### 1.2 Intermittent Monitors

| Monitor | Frequency | Method | Documentation |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Blood Pressure (Non-invasive)** | **Minimum every 5 minutes** | Automated NIBP or manual auscultation | Record all values in anesthetic record |
| **Temperature** | Capability must be immediately available; continuous when risk of hypothermia or hyperthermia | Esophageal, nasopharyngeal, bladder, or skin probe | Document baseline and any significant changes |
| **Neuromuscular Function (TOF)** | When neuromuscular blocking drugs used: baseline, after administration, before reversal, post-reversal | Quantitative (acceleromyography preferred) or qualitative nerve stimulator | Document TOF count and ratio; see Section 6 |

**Blood pressure monitoring specifics:**
- Minimum interval: 5 minutes throughout anesthetic
- More frequent measurement (every 1-3 minutes) during:
  - Induction and emergence
  - Periods of hemodynamic instability
  - Administration of vasoactive medications
  - Tourniquet inflation/deflation
  - Significant surgical events (cementing, reduction, etc.)

**Temperature monitoring:**
- Continuous measurement indicated when:
  - Anticipated procedure duration >30 minutes
  - Active warming or cooling measures employed
  - Patient at risk for malignant hyperthermia
  - Pediatric or geriatric patient
  - Significant fluid resuscitation anticipated

### 1.3 Documentation Requirements

**Mandatory documentation elements:**

**Pre-induction:**

## 2. Intraoperative Monitoring by Phase

### 2.1 Pre-Induction

**Timing:** After patient arrival in OR, before induction agents administered

**Monitoring established:**

| Parameter | Action | Standard |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Pulse oximetry** | Apply and verify waveform | SpO₂ display and waveform visible |
| **ECG** | Apply electrodes and verify rhythm | Clear rhythm strip, rate displayed |
| **Blood pressure** | Obtain baseline NIBP | Record baseline value before any medications |
| **Respiratory rate** | Assess and document | Baseline RR while awake |
| **Level of consciousness** | Assess baseline mental status | Alert and oriented, or document baseline if altered |
| **Airway assessment** | Final verification of airway exam | Mallampati, thyromental distance, neck mobility documented |

**Pre-induction checklist:**

- Emergency medications drawn (phenylephrine, ephedrine, atropine/glycopyrrolate)
- Neuromuscular blocking reversal agent available (sugammadex)
- Patient positioned appropriately
- All team members ready (anesthesiologist, CRNA, circulating nurse, surgeon)

### 2.2 Induction

**Timing:** From administration of induction agents through securing of airway

**Enhanced monitoring during induction:**

| Parameter | Frequency | Action Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Blood pressure** | **Every 1-2 minutes** (automated cycling or continuous if arterial line) | Notify anesthesiologist if MAP <65 mmHg or SBP <90 mmHg unless individualized target different |
| **Heart rate** | Continuous ECG display | Notify if HR <50 or >120 unless expected based on medications |
| **SpO₂** | Continuous with audible tone | Immediate intervention if <92% |
| **Capnography** | Continuous after intubation | Verify EtCO₂ waveform immediately upon intubation; absence suggests esophageal intubation |
| **Airway pressures** | Continuous monitoring once ventilation initiated | High pressure alarm may indicate bronchospasm, kinked tube, or mainstem intubation |

**Critical induction monitoring points:**

**Pre-oxygenation phase:**
- SpO₂ should reach ≥95% (ideally >98%) before induction
- Verify adequate mask seal and tidal volumes if pre-oxygenating with positive pressure

**Apneic phase (after induction, before intubation):**
- Continuous SpO₂ monitoring
- Note time of apnea onset
- Prepare for mask ventilation if SpO₂ declining or extended apneic period

**Immediate post-intubation:**
- **Confirm endotracheal tube placement:**
  - Bilateral breath sounds auscultation
  - **EtCO₂ waveform present (gold standard)**
  - Symmetric chest rise
  - Absence of gastric insufflation sounds
  - Mist in endotracheal tube on exhalation
- Secure tube and document depth at teeth/lips
- Obtain post-intubation vital signs
- Verify ventilator settings appropriate

**Induction complication monitoring:**

| Complication | Monitoring Clues | Immediate Action |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Hypotension** | MAP <65, SBP <90 | Phenylephrine 50-100 mcg IV or ephedrine 5-10 mg IV; reduce anesthetic depth if appropriate |
| **Severe bradycardia** | HR <50 with hypotension or <45 regardless | Glycopyrrolate 0.2-0.4 mg IV; reduce/stop dexmedetomidine if running |
| **Esophageal intubation** | No EtCO₂ waveform, declining SpO₂, gastric sounds | Immediate extubation and re-intubation |
| **Mainstem intubation** | Unilateral breath sounds, high peak pressures, declining SpO₂ | Withdraw ETT 1-2 cm and reassess |
| **Bronchospasm** | Wheezing, high peak pressures, upsloping EtCO₂ waveform | Deepen anesthesia; consider bronchodilators |
| **Laryngospasm** | Inability to ventilate, stridor, paradoxical chest movement | Positive pressure, deepening, muscle relaxation |

### 2.3 Maintenance

**Timing:** From completion of intubation/positioning through start of emergence

**Standard monitoring intervals:**

| Parameter | Frequency | Documentation |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Blood pressure** | Every 3-5 minutes (minimum every 5 minutes per ASA) | Every value recorded |
| **Heart rate** | Continuous display, documented every 5 minutes minimum | Continuous rhythm monitoring |
| **SpO₂** | Continuous display and recording | Continuous waveform assessment |
| **EtCO₂** | Continuous display and recording | Waveform analysis; trending |
| **Respiratory rate** | Continuous if ventilated; displayed with ventilator | Document RR and minute ventilation |
| **Temperature** | Continuous if probe placed; intermittent if not | Minimum every 30 minutes if not continuous |
| **Inspired/Expired anesthetic agent** | Continuous if volatile anesthetic used | MAC tracking; ensure adequate delivery |
| **TOF** | After NMBD administration, before reversal | Baseline, post-paralytic, pre-reversal |

**Maintenance phase critical monitoring:**

**Hemodynamic targets (general guidance):**
- MAP ≥65 mmHg (individualize to patient baseline and comorbidities)
- Heart rate 50-100 bpm (individualize based on patient)
- SpO₂ ≥95% (≥92% acceptable in some patients with chronic lung disease)

**Ventilation targets:**
- EtCO₂ 35-45 mmHg (adjust for patient-specific needs)
- Tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight
- Respiratory rate adjusted to achieve target EtCO₂
- Peak inspiratory pressure <30 cmH₂O (typically)
- Plateau pressure <25 cmH₂O if measured

**Protocol-specific maintenance monitoring:**

**Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) and Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free):**
- Standard ASA monitoring sufficient for most patients
- Consider processed EEG in elderly to avoid excessive depth
- Monitor for dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia (HR <50)
- Monitor for ketamine-related hypertension if used

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**
- Standard ASA monitoring
- Assess respiratory pattern if spontaneous ventilation occurring
- Monitor for opioid-related bradycardia and hypotension
- Anticipate potential for prolonged effect

**Significant surgical events requiring enhanced monitoring:**

| Event | Monitoring Emphasis | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Tourniquet inflation** | BP, HR immediately after | Potential for hypertension, increased afterload |
| **Tourniquet deflation** | BP, HR for 5-10 minutes after | Risk of hypotension from reperfusion, metabolite washout |
| **Cementing** | BP, HR, SpO₂, EtCO₂ | Risk of bone cement implantation syndrome (rare but serious) |
| **Component reduction/implantation** | BP, HR | Potential for vagal response, embolization |
| **Significant blood loss** | BP, HR, UOP if catheterized, consider Hgb | Hemorrhage detection and resuscitation guidance |

**Temperature management:**
- Hypothermia (core temp <36°C) increases surgical site infection risk, coagulopathy, cardiac events
- Active warming (forced air warmer) indicated for most cases
- Monitor temperature continuously when active warming used
- Target normothermia (36-37°C)

### 2.4 Emergence

**Timing:** From last surgical suture through extubation and initial recovery

**Enhanced monitoring during emergence:**

| Parameter | Frequency | Target |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Blood pressure** | Every 1-2 minutes | Maintain within 20% of baseline; avoid severe hypertension |
| **Heart rate** | Continuous | 50-100 bpm; avoid tachycardia >120 |
| **SpO₂** | Continuous | Maintain ≥95% |
| **EtCO₂** | Continuous until extubation | Monitor for hypoventilation as sedation lightens |
| **Respiratory rate** | Continuous | Spontaneous RR >10, adequate tidal volume |
| **Neuromuscular function (TOF)** | Before extubation | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 mandatory** |
| **Level of consciousness** | Continuous assessment | Eye opening to voice, following commands |

**Emergence checklist:**

**10-15 minutes before anticipated emergence:**
- Taper/stop adjunct infusions (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine if used)
- Reduce propofol infusion rate or decrease sevoflurane concentration
- Ensure adequate analgesia administered (ondansetron, multimodal analgesics)
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV if not already given
- Prepare sugammadex for neuromuscular reversal

**At skin closure/dressing application:**
- Further reduce hypnotic depth
- Begin transitioning to spontaneous ventilation if appropriate
- Assess neuromuscular function (TOF)

**Pre-extubation assessment:**

| Criterion | Assessment Method | Required Standard |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Consciousness** | Response to verbal stimuli | Eye opening, purposeful movement, following commands |
| **Ventilation** | Observation, capnography, spirometry if available | Tidal volume ≥5 mL/kg (≥6-8 mL/kg preferred for Protocol 3), RR 10-20, EtCO₂ 35-45 |
| **Oxygenation** | Pulse oximetry | SpO₂ ≥95% on FiO₂ ≤50% |
| **Neuromuscular function** | TOF monitoring | **TOF ratio ≥0.9** (quantitative preferred); sustained head lift 5 seconds, hand grip strength |
| **Hemodynamic stability** | Vital signs | BP and HR stable and within acceptable range |
| **Airway reflexes** | Gag, cough present | Adequate protective reflexes |

**Protocol-specific extubation criteria:**

**Protocols 1 & 2 (OFIA pathways):**
- Standard extubation criteria as above
- Typically smooth, rapid emergence
- Low threshold for extubation when criteria met

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**
- **More stringent criteria required**
- Fully awake with minimal or no somnolence
- Robust spontaneous ventilation (TV ≥6-8 mL/kg, sustained RR 12-20)
- Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
- Strong hand grip bilaterally
- **Do NOT extubate if any concerning somnolence or respiratory depression**
- Lower threshold to delay extubation and continue monitoring
- Consider naloxone availability at bedside (0.04-0.08 mg IV titrated if needed)

**Post-extubation immediate monitoring:**
- Continuous SpO₂, ECG, NIBP every 2-3 minutes
- Assess ventilation adequacy (rate, depth, work of breathing)
- Provide supplemental oxygen (typically face mask or nasal cannula)
- Monitor for laryngospasm, bronchospasm, airway obstruction
- Assess pain level and treat appropriately
- Remain at bedside until patient stable and ready for transport

### 2.5 Pre-Transfer to PACU

**Stabilization criteria before transport:**

- Patient awake or easily arousable
- Adequate spontaneous ventilation (RR 10-20, SpO₂ ≥92% on supplemental O₂)
- Hemodynamically stable (no active vasopressor requirement unless chronic)
- No active bleeding
- Pain controlled or plan in place
- Temperature ≥36°C or active warming in place
- All monitoring equipment ready for transport

**Transport monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry mandatory
- Supplemental oxygen during transport
- ECG monitoring during transport (if telemetry available)
- NIBP capability available
- Anesthesia provider accompanies patient to PACU
- Emergency medications and airway equipment accompany transport

## 3. Regional Anesthesia Monitoring

### 3.1 During Block Placement

**Applies to:** Protocol 1 (ACB + IPACK) and Protocol 3 if blocks performed

**Monitoring requirements during nerve block placement:**

| Monitor | Requirement | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Pulse oximetry** | Continuous | Detect early hypoxemia from sedation or LAST |
| **ECG** | Continuous | Detect LAST-related arrhythmias |
| **Blood pressure** | Every 2-3 minutes or continuous | Detect hemodynamic changes from sedation or LAST |
| **Level of consciousness** | Continuous verbal contact if patient awake | Detect early CNS toxicity symptoms |
| **Capnography** | If moderate sedation used | Detect hypoventilation from sedation |

**Sedation during block placement:**

**Minimal to moderate sedation commonly used:**
- Midazolam 1-2 mg IV (reduce to 0.5-1 mg in elderly/frail)
- Fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV (optional, use sparingly)
- Goal: Anxiolysis and comfort while maintaining verbal responsiveness

**Monitoring during sedation:**

## 4. Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring

### 4.1 When to Use Processed EEG

**Processed EEG monitors (BIS, Entropy, SedLine, etc.) are OPTIONAL adjuncts**

**Not required for routine rTKA but consider in:**

| Clinical Scenario | Rationale | Expected Benefit |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Elderly patients (>65-70 years)** | Reduce risk of excessive anesthetic depth associated with delirium | Titrate to lighter anesthetic depth while maintaining adequate hypnosis |
| **Frail patients** | Minimize drug exposure and hemodynamic perturbations | Guide conservative anesthetic dosing |
| **High-risk cardiac disease** | Optimize hemodynamics by avoiding excessive depth | Reduce myocardial depression from anesthetics |
| **TIVA technique without volatile agent** | No end-tidal agent monitoring available | Confirm adequate hypnosis; detect awareness risk |
| **History of awareness under anesthesia** | Patient anxiety and medicolegal risk | Provide objective depth monitoring |
| **Neuromuscular blockade throughout** | Cannot assess movement as depth indicator | Alternative depth assessment |

**NOT routinely indicated for:**
- Healthy, low-risk patients
- When volatile agent end-tidal monitoring provides adequate depth guidance
- When clinical signs (HR, BP, movement) provide sufficient depth assessment

### 4.2 Target Ranges by Agent

**General BIS target ranges for surgical anesthesia:**

| BIS Value | Interpretation | Clinical Context |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **90-100** | Awake | Pre-induction or emergence |
| **60-80** | Light sedation | Inadequate for surgery; risk of awareness |
| **40-60** | **General anesthesia (typical target)** | Appropriate surgical depth for most patients |
| **20-40** | Deep anesthesia | May be excessive; associated with delirium in elderly; consider lightening |
| **<20** | Very deep anesthesia / burst suppression | Avoid unless specific indication (neuroprotection); associated with adverse outcomes |

**Age-adjusted considerations:**
- Elderly patients (>65): Consider target BIS 45-60 to avoid excessive depth
- Younger patients: BIS 40-50 often appropriate
- **Individual variability exists**; use BIS as one data point among many

**Agent-specific considerations:**

**Propofol:**
- BIS reliably correlates with propofol effect
- Target BIS 40-60 for maintenance
- BIS useful for TIVA titration

**Sevoflurane:**
- BIS correlates reasonably with sevoflurane depth
- End-tidal agent concentration (MAC) remains primary guide
- BIS may help avoid excessive depth in elderly

**Ketamine:**
- **CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Ketamine increases cortical activity and can INCREASE BIS despite adequate anesthesia
- BIS may read 60-80 even when patient adequately anesthetized
- **Do NOT titrate hypnotic solely to BIS when using ketamine**
- Use clinical signs, hemodynamics, and hypnotic agent dosing as primary guides

**Dexmedetomidine:**
- Minimal direct effect on BIS
- May contribute to overall sedation but BIS primarily reflects hypnotic (propofol/volatile)

**Nitrous oxide:**
- May increase BIS despite adequate anesthesia
- Less commonly used in modern ERAS pathways

### 4.3 Special Considerations (Ketamine, Elderly)

**Ketamine and processed EEG:**

**Pharmacologic mechanism:**
- Ketamine produces dissociative anesthesia
- Increases cerebral metabolic rate and cortical activity
- EEG shows increased beta activity
- BIS value increases (paradoxically appears "lighter")

**Clinical management:**
- Do NOT rely on BIS as sole depth indicator when using ketamine
- Titrate hypnotic (propofol or sevoflurane) based on:
  - End-tidal agent concentration (if volatile)
  - Propofol infusion rate
  - Hemodynamic response
  - Clinical signs (movement if not paralyzed)
- Accept higher BIS values (60-75 may be appropriate with ketamine adjunct)

**Elderly patients and depth monitoring:**

**Rationale for lighter anesthetic targets:**
- Postoperative delirium strongly associated with intraoperative anesthetic depth
- Elderly patients more sensitive to anesthetics (pharmacodynamic changes)
- Excessive depth provides no benefit and increases harm

**Evidence-based approach:**
- Target BIS 45-60 in elderly (vs 40-60 in younger patients)
- Minimize time with BIS <40
- Use lowest effective anesthetic dose
- Combine with multimodal analgesia to reduce anesthetic requirements

**Monitoring strategy:**
- Baseline BIS before induction (should be 90-95 awake)
- Avoid BIS <40 during maintenance if possible
- Trend BIS over time; avoid sustained deep anesthesia
- Lighten anesthesia as surgical stimulus decreases

**Limitations and caveats:**
- BIS is one data point; must integrate with clinical picture
- Equipment artifacts (electrocautery, patient movement) affect readings
- Individual variability exists
- No processed EEG monitor prevents awareness or delirium with 100% certainty

## 5. Invasive Monitoring Indications

### 5.1 Arterial Line

**Arterial catheter provides:**
- Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring
- Arterial blood gas sampling capability
- Waveform analysis (if advanced monitoring used)

**Indications for arterial line in rTKA:**

**Strong indications (strongly consider):**
- Severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF <30%)
- Severe aortic stenosis or other critical valvular disease
- Recent myocardial infarction (<6 months)
- Unstable angina or active cardiac ischemia
- Uncontrolled hypertension requiring precise BP management
- Anticipated significant hemodynamic lability
- Pulmonary hypertension requiring tight hemodynamic control

**Relative indications (consider based on clinical judgment):**
- Moderate cardiac dysfunction (EF 30-40%)
- Multiple cardiac risk factors with poor functional capacity
- Chronic kidney disease requiring frequent blood gas monitoring
- Anticipated need for frequent laboratory sampling
- Morbid obesity where NIBP unreliable
- Anesthesiologist or institutional preference in high-risk patient

**NOT routinely indicated for:**
- Healthy, low-risk patients
- Stable cardiac disease with good functional capacity
- Routine rTKA in ASA I-II patients

**Arterial line monitoring specifics:**

**Placement:**
- Most commonly radial artery (Allen test if concerned about collateral flow)
- Alternative sites: femoral, brachial (higher risk), dorsalis pedis
- Ultrasound guidance increases success and reduces complications
- Sterile technique mandatory

**Calibration and setup:**
- Transducer leveled at phlebostatic axis (right atrium level)
- Pressure bag inflated to 300 mmHg
- System zeroed to atmospheric pressure before use
- Continuous flush device functioning

**Waveform interpretation:**
- Normal: Sharp upstroke, dicrotic notch, gradual downslope
- Overdamped: Loss of dicrotic notch, falsely low systolic (check for air, kinks, clot)
- Underdamped: Exaggerated waveform, falsely high systolic (acceptable if recognizes)

**Complications:**
- Thrombosis, hematoma, infection, nerve injury (rare)
- Distal ischemia (very rare with radial artery)
- Ensure adequate perfusion monitoring of catheterized extremity

### 5.2 Central Venous Access

**Central venous catheter (CVC) provides:**
- Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring
- Reliable IV access for vasoactive medications
- Route for large-volume resuscitation
- Access for pulmonary artery catheter placement (if needed)

**Indications for CVC in rTKA:**

**Strong indications (rare for routine rTKA):**
- Severe right or left ventricular dysfunction requiring vasoactive infusions
- Anticipated need for high-dose vasopressors
- Severely limited peripheral IV access in high-risk patient
- Need for CVP-guided fluid management in severe cardiac disease

**Relative indications:**
- Moderate-severe cardiac dysfunction in patient with difficult peripheral access
- Anticipated large fluid shifts in high-risk patient
- Anesthesiologist preference in very high-risk case

**NOT routinely indicated for:**
- Routine rTKA in any ASA classification
- Most patients with stable cardiac disease
- Patients with adequate peripheral IV access

**CVC monitoring specifics:**

**Placement sites:**
- Internal jugular (most common, lowest complication rate)
- Subclavian (higher pneumothorax risk)
- Femoral (higher infection risk, limits mobilization)
- Ultrasound guidance mandatory per current guidelines

**CVP monitoring:**
- Transducer leveled at phlebostatic axis
- Normal CVP range: 2-8 mmHg (highly variable)
- CVP trends more useful than absolute values
- CVP poorly predicts fluid responsiveness (dynamic measures superior)

**Complications:**
- Arterial puncture, hematoma, pneumothorax, hemothorax
- Arrhythmias during placement
- Infection (catheter-related bloodstream infection)
- Venous thrombosis

### 5.3 Advanced Hemodynamic Monitoring

**Advanced monitors (rarely needed for routine rTKA):**

**Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC):**
- Measures cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, mixed venous oxygen saturation
- **Almost never indicated for routine rTKA**
- Possible consideration: Severe pulmonary hypertension or complex cardiac disease where PA pressures critical to management
- High complication risk; requires specialized training
- Has NOT been shown to improve outcomes in most perioperative settings

**Minimally invasive cardiac output monitors:**
- Arterial waveform analysis (FloTrac, LiDCO, PiCCO)
- Esophageal Doppler
- Transthoracic bioimpedance/bioreactance
- **Rarely indicated for routine rTKA**
- May be useful in severe cardiac disease if anesthesiologist experienced with technology
- Goal-directed fluid therapy protocols may use these monitors in high-risk patients

**Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE):**
- Real-time cardiac function and volume status assessment
- **Not routine for rTKA**
- Possible consideration: Severe cardiac disease with unclear etiology of hemodynamic instability
- Requires advanced training and certification
- Contraindications: esophageal pathology, recent esophageal surgery

**Practical guidance for rTKA:**
- Advanced hemodynamic monitoring rarely changes management in routine cases
- Standard ASA monitors + arterial line (when indicated) sufficient for vast majority
- If considering advanced monitoring, likely indicates need for ICU-level postoperative care
- Risk-benefit analysis essential; monitoring itself carries risks

## 6. Neuromuscular Monitoring

### 6.1 TOF Monitoring Protocol

**Train-of-four (TOF) monitoring is MANDATORY when neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD) used**

**Clinical importance:**
- Residual neuromuscular blockade associated with:
  - Increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications
  - Airway obstruction
  - Aspiration
  - Hypoxemia
  - Patient discomfort and anxiety
- Quantitative monitoring superior to qualitative assessment
- Clinical assessment alone inadequate to exclude residual blockade

**TOF monitoring basics:**

**Mechanism:**
- Four electrical stimuli delivered over 2 seconds to peripheral nerve
- Muscle contraction assessed (visual, tactile, or quantitative)
- Fade in response indicates partial neuromuscular blockade
- TOF ratio = (fourth twitch strength / first twitch strength)

**Quantitative vs qualitative:**

| Method | Technology | Accuracy | Clinical Use |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Quantitative** | Acceleromyography (most common), electromyography, kinemyography | Provides objective TOF ratio; gold standard | **Preferred**; allows precise assessment of recovery |
| **Qualitative** | Visual or tactile assessment of twitches | Subjective; cannot reliably detect TOF ratio <0.9 | Acceptable if quantitative unavailable; less reliable |

**Nerve stimulation sites:**

| Site | Nerve | Muscle Response | Notes |
|------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Ulnar nerve (most common)** | Ulnar at wrist | Adductor pollicis (thumb adduction) | Most reliable; preferred site |
| **Facial nerve** | Facial at temple | Orbicularis oculi (eye twitch) | Faster recovery than peripheral; may overestimate readiness |
| **Posterior tibial nerve** | Posterior tibial at ankle | Flexor hallucis brevis (great toe flexion) | Useful if arms inaccessible |

**Electrode placement:**
- Ulnar nerve: Two electrodes along ulnar nerve at wrist, 3-6 cm apart
- Ensure good skin contact (clean, dry skin)
- Stimulating current typically 30-60 mA

### 6.2 TOF Monitoring Timeline

**Baseline (before NMBD administration):**
- Establish TOF monitoring and obtain baseline response
- Should see four equal twitches (TOF ratio = 1.0)
- Baseline establishes function of monitoring equipment

**After NMBD administration:**
- TOF monitoring confirms onset of blockade
- Complete blockade: No twitches visible (TOF count = 0)
- Deep blockade: 1-2 twitches (post-tetanic count may be used)
- Moderate blockade: 3-4 twitches with fade
- Timing of intubation typically when TOF count = 0 or 1-2 twitches

**During maintenance:**
- Monitor TOF if additional NMBD doses given or infusion used
- For rTKA, single intubating dose typically sufficient for entire case
- If surgery prolonged, assess TOF before considering redosing

**Before reversal:**
- **Mandatory TOF assessment**
- Determines appropriate sugammadex dose:
  - TOF count ≥2 twitches: Sugammadex 2 mg/kg
  - TOF count 1 twitch or post-tetanic count 1-2: Sugammadex 4 mg/kg
  - Deep blockade (no response to TOF or PTC): Sugammadex 4 mg/kg or wait for spontaneous recovery

**After reversal:**
- **Mandatory TOF assessment before extubation**
- Must document TOF ratio ≥0.9 (quantitative) or sustained tetanus/no fade (qualitative)
- Typically reassess 2-5 minutes after sugammadex administration
- If inadequate recovery, wait and reassess; consider additional sugammadex per institutional protocol

### 6.3 Reversal Criteria

**Quantitative monitoring (preferred):**
- **TOF ratio ≥0.9 required before extubation**
- TOF ratio 0.7-0.9: Clinical weakness likely; DO NOT extubate
- TOF ratio <0.7: Significant residual blockade; DO NOT extubate

**Qualitative monitoring (if quantitative unavailable):**
- Sustained tetanus (50 Hz for 5 seconds) without fade
- Four equal twitches on TOF stimulation
- Clinical criteria:
  - Sustained head lift >5 seconds
  - Strong hand grip bilaterally
  - Sustained leg raise against gravity
  - Ability to maintain tongue protrusion
  - Vital capacity >15-20 mL/kg (if measured)

**CRITICAL: Clinical assessment alone is unreliable**
- Adequate clinical strength does NOT exclude TOF ratio <0.9
- Studies show patients appearing clinically strong may have TOF ratio 0.7-0.8
- Always use objective monitoring when available

**Sugammadex dosing and monitoring:**

| Degree of Blockade | Assessment | Sugammadex Dose | Expected Recovery Time |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Moderate** | TOF count ≥2 twitches | 2 mg/kg IV | 2-3 minutes to TOF ≥0.9 |
| **Deep** | TOF count 1 twitch or PTC 1-2 | 4 mg/kg IV | 2-5 minutes to TOF ≥0.9 |
| **Profound** | No response to TOF or PTC | 4 mg/kg IV or wait | Variable; may require 5-10 minutes |
| **Immediate reversal** | Within 3 minutes of rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg | 16 mg/kg IV (rarely used) | ~3 minutes |

**Post-reversal monitoring:**
- Reassess TOF 2-5 minutes after sugammadex
- If TOF ratio <0.9, continue monitoring and reassess
- Recurarization with sugammadex is extremely rare but monitor for adequacy of ventilation
- Maintain monitoring through emergence and early PACU period

### 6.4 Documentation

**Mandatory neuromuscular monitoring documentation:**

**Intraoperative record must include:**
- NMBD given (drug, dose, time)
- TOF assessment before reversal (count and/or ratio)
- Reversal agent given (sugammadex dose, time)
- TOF assessment after reversal (count and/or ratio)
- Clinical assessment of neuromuscular function at extubation

**Example documentation:**
- "Rocuronium 50 mg IV at 0815 for intubation"
- "Pre-reversal TOF 4/4 with fade, ratio 0.45 at 1030"
- "Sugammadex 140 mg IV (2 mg/kg) at 1032"
- "Post-reversal TOF ratio 0.95 at 1035; sustained head lift, strong hand grip; extubated"

**Quality metrics:**
- Institutional monitoring of neuromuscular blockade management
- Track percentage of cases with documented quantitative TOF monitoring
- Track percentage of cases with documented TOF ratio ≥0.9 before extubation
- Audit postoperative respiratory complications related to residual blockade

## 7. PACU Monitoring Standards

### 7.1 Admission Criteria and Assessment

**Admission to PACU:**
- Patient accompanied by anesthesia provider during transport
- Continuous monitoring during transport (minimum pulse oximetry and supplemental oxygen)
- Verbal handoff to PACU RN (see Section 10.1)

**Immediate PACU admission assessment (within 5 minutes of arrival):**

| Parameter | Assessment | Documentation |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Airway** | Patent, patient maintaining own airway | Note any airway adjuncts in place |
| **Breathing** | Rate, depth, effort, breath sounds | Respiratory rate and pattern |
| **Circulation** | Heart rate, blood pressure, rhythm, peripheral perfusion | Initial vital signs |

### 7.2 Continuous vs Intermittent Monitoring

**Continuous monitoring in PACU (all patients):**

| Monitor | Duration | Alarm Settings |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Pulse oximetry** | Until PACU discharge criteria met | Low alarm typically 90-92% (individualize) |
| **ECG** | Until stable and discharge criteria met | Rate and rhythm alarms enabled |
| **Respiratory rate** | Clinical assessment continuous; electronic if high-risk | Low alarm typically <8-10, high >24-30 |

**Intermittent monitoring in PACU (all patients):**

| Parameter | Initial Frequency | Stable Patient Frequency | Documentation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Blood pressure** | Every 5 minutes × 15 minutes | Every 15 minutes until discharge | All values recorded |
| **Heart rate** | Every 5 minutes × 15 minutes | Every 15 minutes (continuous display) | All values recorded |
| **Respiratory rate** | Every 5 minutes × 15 minutes | Every 15 minutes | All values recorded |
| **SpO₂** | Continuous display | Continuous display | Periodic documentation |
| **Pain score** | Every 15 minutes or with vital signs | Every 30 minutes if well-controlled | All scores recorded |
| **Sedation score** | Every 15 minutes initially | Every 30 minutes if stable | All scores recorded |
| **Temperature** | On admission, then PRN | If hypothermic, every 30 min until normothermic | All values recorded |
| **PONV assessment** | Every 15-30 minutes | PRN | Episodes documented |

**Sedation scales:**

**Pasero Opioid-Induced Sedation Scale (POSS) - commonly used:**
- S = Sleep, easy to arouse (acceptable)
- 1 = Awake and alert (acceptable)
- 2 = Slightly drowsy, easily arousable (acceptable)
- 3 = Frequently drowsy, arousable, drifts off during conversation (concerning; reduce opioids)
- 4 = Somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal/physical stimulation (unacceptable; stop opioids, consider naloxone)

**Alternative: Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS):**
- +4 to 0: Agitated to alert
- -1 to -5: Drowsy to unarousable
- Target typically -1 to 0 (drowsy but arousable to alert)

### 7.3 Protocol-Specific Requirements (1, 2, 3)

**Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) - Standard PACU monitoring:**

**Continuous monitoring:**
- Pulse oximetry: Minimum 1 hour (longer if any concerns)
- ECG: Until stable and ready for discharge
- Supplemental oxygen: Typically 2-4 L/min nasal cannula; wean as tolerated

**Enhanced monitoring NOT routinely required**
- Low expected opioid requirement
- Low respiratory depression risk
- Regional blocks provide analgesia

**Block-specific assessments:**
- Motor function: Assess quadriceps strength before mobilization attempt
  - Expected: Preserved strength (motor-sparing blocks)
  - Document strength on 0-5 scale
- Sensory function: Assess distribution of residual block
  - Expected: Diminished sensation medial leg/knee, posterior knee
- Falls risk: Enhanced precautions until block fully resolved
  - Bed alarm, assistance with first ambulation
  - Reassess with each mobilization attempt

**Typical PACU course:**
- Pain scores typically 0-3/10
- Minimal rescue analgesia needed
- Often ready for discharge in 60-90 minutes if stable

**Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) - Standard to enhanced monitoring:**

**Continuous monitoring:**
- Pulse oximetry: Minimum 1-2 hours
- ECG: Until stable and ready for discharge
- Supplemental oxygen: 2-4 L/min nasal cannula; wean as tolerated

**Enhanced monitoring considerations:**
- Higher pain scores expected vs Protocol 1 (typically 2-5/10)
- More rescue analgesia likely needed
- If multiple opioid doses required, consider capnography

**Capnography indications in Protocol 2:**
- Cumulative opioid dose concerning (e.g., hydromorphone >1 mg total)
- Sedation score ≥3
- Respiratory rate <10
- SpO₂ declining despite supplemental oxygen
- OSA or other high respiratory risk factors

**Typical PACU course:**
- More variable pain control than Protocol 1
- Rescue analgesia frequently needed
- PACU stay 90-120 minutes typical

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) - Enhanced monitoring MANDATORY:**

**Continuous monitoring (strictly enforced):**
- **Pulse oximetry: MANDATORY continuous until fully awake and stable**
  - Minimum 2 hours; longer if any concerns
  - Audible alarm enabled
  - Low threshold to continue monitoring on floor
- ECG: Continuous until discharge
- Supplemental oxygen: Maintain SpO₂ ≥95%

**Capnography: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for high-risk patients:**

**Capnography mandatory if ANY of:**
- OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)
- Age >70 with significant opioid exposure intraoperatively

- Sedation score every 10-15 minutes (NOT every 30 minutes)
- Respiratory rate every 10-15 minutes with low threshold for concern
- Pain score every 15 minutes

**Rescue analgesia approach:**
- Titrate opioids VERY carefully (hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV, reassess 20 minutes)
- Lower threshold to use non-opioid rescue (ketamine if available per protocol)
- Reassess sedation before each opioid dose
- Consider multimodal optimization before escalating opioids

**Naloxone:**
- **Immediately available at bedside**
- Drawn and ready if concerning sedation or respiratory pattern
- Typical dose: 0.04-0.08 mg IV, titrate to effect
- Goal: Restore respiratory drive, NOT full reversal (avoid pain crisis)

**Discharge from PACU:**
- **More stringent criteria than Protocols 1 & 2**
- Fully awake, minimal residual sedation
- Stable respiratory pattern (RR >10, SpO₂ ≥92%)
- Pain controlled without excessive opioid requirement
- Consider need for enhanced floor monitoring (continuous pulse oximetry)

### 7.4 PACU Discharge Criteria

**General discharge criteria (all protocols):**

**Modified Aldrete Score ≥9 (or institutional equivalent):**
- Respiratory function adequate
- Oxygen saturation acceptable
- Consciousness appropriate

## 8. Floor Monitoring (0-24 Hours)

### 8.1 Standard Vital Signs Protocol

**Routine postoperative vital signs (all protocols):**

| Parameter | Frequency | Documentation | Normal Range |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Blood pressure** | Every 4 hours | All values | Individualize to patient baseline |
| **Heart rate** | Every 4 hours | All values | 50-100 bpm (individualize) |
| **Respiratory rate** | Every 4 hours | All values | 12-20 breaths/min |
| **Oxygen saturation** | Every 4 hours (continuous if high-risk) | All values | ≥92% (≥95% preferred) |
| **Temperature** | Every 4 hours | All values | 36-38°C |
| **Pain score** | With each vital sign check | All scores | Goal ≤4/10 or acceptable to patient |
| **Sedation score** | With each vital sign check if opioids used | All scores | Goal ≤2 (awake, easily arousable) |

**First set of vital signs on floor:**
- Obtain immediately upon arrival (within 15 minutes)
- Establishes baseline for floor care
- Any significant changes from PACU discharge values trigger reassessment

**Nighttime vital signs:**
- Continue every 4 hours unless modified by provider order
- Balance monitoring needs with sleep promotion
- Consider less frequent checks (every 6 hours) after POD 0 if stable and low-risk

### 8.2 Enhanced Monitoring Criteria

**Enhanced monitoring frequency triggers:**

**Increase vital sign frequency to every 2 hours if ANY:**
- Systolic BP <90 or >180 mmHg
- Heart rate <50 or >110 bpm
- Respiratory rate <10 or >24 breaths/min
- SpO₂ <92% on room air (or below baseline)
- Temperature <36°C or >38.5°C
- Pain score >6/10 despite intervention
- Sedation score ≥3 (frequent drowsiness or worse)
- Any acute change in mental status
- New-onset nausea/vomiting not responding to treatment
- Surgical site concerns (bleeding, swelling, neurovascular changes)

**Continuous pulse oximetry on floor - indications:**

**Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry for:**
- Protocol 3 patients with OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)
- Protocol 3 patients age >75 with significant intraoperative opioid exposure
- Any patient with respiratory event in PACU
- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- COPD with home oxygen requirement
- Any patient with sedation score ≥3

**Consider continuous pulse oximetry for:**
- Protocol 3 in elderly/frail patients
- Protocol 2 or 3 with high rescue opioid requirement
- Any patient on PCA (patient-controlled analgesia)
- Institutional policy or RN/provider concern

**Continuous pulse oximetry specifications:**
- Audible alarm enabled
- Low alarm threshold typically 90-92%
- RN response to alarm immediate
- Document rationale and duration

**Capnography on floor:**
- Rarely available outside ICU/step-down units
- If available, consider for very high-risk patients (severe OSA, obesity hypoventilation, concerning respiratory pattern)
- Most institutions rely on pulse oximetry + clinical assessment on floor

### 8.3 Early Warning Scores

**Early warning score systems standardize recognition of deteriorating patients**

**Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) - example:**

| Parameter | Score 3 | Score 2 | Score 1 | Score 0 | Score 1 | Score 2 | Score 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Respiratory Rate** | - | - | <9 | 9-14 | 15-20 | 21-29 | ≥30 |
| **Heart Rate** | - | <40 | 41-50 | 51-100 | 101-110 | 111-129 | ≥130 |
| **Systolic BP** | <70 | 71-80 | 81-100 | 101-199 | - | ≥200 | - |
| **Temperature** | - | <35 | - | 35-38.4 | - | ≥38.5 | - |
| **AVPU** | - | - | - | Alert | Voice | Pain | Unresponsive |

**AVPU:** Alert / responds to Voice / responds to Pain / Unresponsive

**Score interpretation:**
- 0-2: Low risk; routine monitoring
- 3-4: Medium risk; increase monitoring frequency, notify provider
- ≥5: High risk; urgent provider notification, consider rapid response team

**Alternative: NEWS (National Early Warning Score):**
- Similar concept with additional parameters (SpO₂, supplemental oxygen)
- Widely used internationally
- Institutional variation in which system used

**Institutional implementation:**
- Use institution's adopted early warning score system
- Score calculated with each vital sign set
- Clear escalation protocol when thresholds exceeded
- Documentation of score and actions taken

### 8.4 Escalation Pathways

**Tiered response to patient deterioration:**

**Tier 1 - Increased monitoring (RN-initiated):**

**Triggers:**

- Pain score >6/10
- Patient complaint or concern
- Early warning score 3-4

**Actions:**
- Increase vital sign frequency to every 2 hours
- Reassess in 30-60 minutes
- Intervene per standing orders (analgesics, antiemetics, etc.)
- Document and continue monitoring

- Document event and response

**Tier 4 - Code Blue (cardiac arrest):**
- Unresponsive, not breathing, no pulse
- Activate code blue per institutional protocol
- Initiate CPR
- Use AED/defibrillator when available

**Anesthesia-specific escalation considerations:**

**When to notify anesthesia provider:**
- Respiratory depression (RR <10, SpO₂ <92%, sedation score ≥3)
- Suspected LAST (even if resolved)
- Hemodynamic instability unexplained by surgical bleeding
- Any concern related to anesthetic management
- Patient or family request

**When to notify surgical team:**

---

## 9. Special Population Monitoring

### 9.1 OSA Patients

**Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients at increased risk for:**
- Postoperative respiratory depression
- Airway obstruction
- Hypoxemia
- Difficult mask ventilation and intubation (in some patients)
- Adverse cardiovascular events

**Preoperative OSA screening:**
- STOP-Bang questionnaire (score ≥3 suggests high risk)
- Document known OSA, CPAP/BiPAP use, compliance
- Obtain sleep study results if available (AHI, oxygen desaturation index)

**Intraoperative monitoring (standard ASA + considerations):**
- Lower threshold for processed EEG to avoid excessive depth
- Conservative opioid dosing if Protocol 3 used
- Prefer opioid-sparing techniques (Protocols 1 or 2 strongly preferred)

**PACU monitoring (enhanced):**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry mandatory**
- **Capnography strongly recommended** if moderate-severe OSA or Protocol 3
- Supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥95%
- Position: Semi-upright (30-45 degrees) to improve airway patency
- CPAP/BiPAP: Resume in PACU if home user and patient awake enough to tolerate
- Enhanced sedation monitoring (every 10-15 minutes)
- Limit opioid rescue; prefer non-opioid alternatives when safe
- Extended PACU stay often appropriate

**Floor monitoring (enhanced):**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry for first 24 hours** (minimum 12 hours if low-risk OSA)
- Vital signs every 2-4 hours (more frequent than routine)
- Resume home CPAP/BiPAP first night postoperatively
- Semi-upright positioning when in bed
- Supplemental oxygen PRN to maintain SpO₂ ≥92%
- Enhanced RN education regarding OSA risks
- Low threshold for provider notification if any respiratory concerns

**Discharge readiness:**
- Adequate pain control on oral regimen without excessive sedation
- Stable on room air or baseline supplemental oxygen
- Demonstrated ability to use CPAP/BiPAP if home user
- No respiratory events in preceding 6-12 hours

### 9.2 Elderly/Frail

**Elderly (>75 years) and frail patients at increased risk for:**
- Postoperative delirium
- Hemodynamic instability
- Hypothermia
- Prolonged drug effects
- Falls
- Pressure injuries

**Intraoperative monitoring (standard ASA + considerations):**
- **Processed EEG recommended** to avoid excessive anesthetic depth (target BIS 45-60)
- Temperature monitoring continuous (higher hypothermia risk)
- Conservative drug dosing across all agents
- Avoid sustained deep anesthesia (BIS <40)

**PACU monitoring (standard with considerations):**
- Baseline cognitive assessment on admission
- Delirium screening (CAM-ICU or equivalent) if any mental status concerns
- Falls precautions (bed alarm, assist with all movements)
- Pressure injury prevention (frequent repositioning, heel protection)
- Normothermia maintenance (active warming if needed)
- Pain assessment may require alternative scales if cognitive impairment (FLACC, PAINAD)

**Floor monitoring (enhanced environmental approach):**
- Delirium prevention bundle:
  - Reorientation (clocks, calendars, family presence)
  - Cognitive engagement
  - Early mobilization (with assistance)
  - Sleep hygiene (minimize nighttime disruptions)
  - Avoid deliriogenic medications (diphenhydramine, benzodiazepines)
  - Correct sensory impairments (glasses, hearing aids)
- Falls precautions (bed alarm, non-slip footwear, assist with ambulation)
- Vital signs frequency standard unless complications
- Early PT/OT involvement

**Delirium monitoring:**
- Formal delirium screening every 8-12 hours for high-risk patients
- CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for ICU - adapted for floor)
- Document and treat if delirium develops
- Investigate underlying causes (infection, medication, metabolic, pain)

**Reporting:**
- Report all LAST events to institutional quality/safety office
- Consider reporting to www.lipidrescue.org registry
- Debrief with team

### 11.2 Respiratory Depression

**Respiratory depression: Inadequate ventilation to maintain normal gas exchange**

**Etiology in postoperative rTKA:**
- Opioid effect (most common)
- Residual anesthetic agents
- Residual neuromuscular blockade
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Airway obstruction
- Pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, aspiration)

**Monitoring for respiratory depression:**

**Clinical signs:**
- Decreased respiratory rate (RR <10 breaths/min concerning, <8 urgent)
- Shallow breathing (low tidal volume)
- Irregular respiratory pattern
- Increased work of breathing (accessory muscle use, nasal flaring)
- Somnolence, difficulty arousing
- Confusion, agitation (hypoxemia or hypercarbia)
- Cyanosis (late, severe)

**Objective monitoring:**
- **Pulse oximetry:** SpO₂ declining (<92% concerning, <90% urgent)
  - **Limitation:** Lags behind ventilation; supplemental oxygen masks hypoxemia
- **Capnography:** EtCO₂ rising (>50 mmHg concerning, >60 mmHg urgent)
  - **Gold standard** for ventilation assessment but often unavailable on floor
- **Respiratory rate:** Trending downward
- **Sedation scale:** Score ≥3 (frequently drowsy) precedes respiratory depression

**Prevention:**
- Multimodal analgesia to minimize opioid requirement
- Opioid-sparing pathways (Protocols 1 and 2) preferred
- Conservative opioid dosing when needed
- Enhanced monitoring for high-risk patients (OSA, elderly, Protocol 3)
- Avoid benzodiazepines and other sedatives when possible

**Response to respiratory depression:**

**Mild respiratory depression (RR 8-10, SpO₂ 90-92%):**
1. Stimulate patient verbally and physically
2. Encourage deep breaths
3. Apply or increase supplemental oxygen
4. Assess and document sedation level
5. **Hold next opioid dose**
6. Notify provider
7. Increase monitoring frequency (continuous pulse oximetry, every 15 min vitals)
8. Reassess in 15-30 minutes

**Moderate respiratory depression (RR <8, SpO₂ <90%, difficult to arouse):**
1. **Call for help** - do not leave patient alone
2. Stimulate patient, encourage breathing
3. **Apply 100% oxygen** via non-rebreather mask
4. **Consider bag-mask ventilation** if inadequate spontaneous effort
5. **Prepare naloxone:**
   - Dilute 0.4 mg in 10 mL saline (0.04 mg/mL)
   - Give 0.04-0.08 mg IV (1-2 mL) every 2-3 minutes
   - Titrate to adequate ventilation (NOT full reversal - avoid pain crisis)
   - Repeat as needed
6. **Notify provider urgently**
7. Transfer to higher level of care (ICU/step-down) often indicated
8. Investigate cause (opioid excess, residual NMB, obstruction, etc.)

**Severe respiratory depression (RR <6, apneic, unresponsive, SpO₂ <85%):**
1. **Call rapid response team or Code Blue**
2. **Airway, Breathing, Circulation:**
   - Open airway (head tilt-chin lift, jaw thrust)
   - **Bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen**
   - Consider oral/nasal airway
   - Prepare for intubation if needed
3. **Naloxone:**
   - 0.4 mg IV push, repeat every 2-3 minutes as needed
   - Higher doses acceptable in severe emergency
   - Effect onset 1-2 minutes
4. **Assess for other causes:**
   - Check TOF if neuromuscular blockade suspected
   - Airway obstruction (reposition, suction)
   - Aspiration
   - Pneumothorax (rare)
5. ICU transfer for ongoing management and monitoring

**Naloxone specifics:**

**Dosing:**
- **Goal:** Restore adequate ventilation, NOT eliminate analgesia
- Start low (0.04-0.08 mg IV) and titrate
- Full reversal (0.4-0.8 mg) causes severe pain, hypertension, tachycardia, pulmonary edema

**Duration of action:**
- Naloxone half-life ~30-60 minutes
- Shorter than most opioids (fentanyl 2-4 hrs, hydromorphone 2-3 hrs)
- **Re-sedation possible** - monitor for minimum 2 hours after naloxone

**Administration routes:**
- IV preferred (fastest onset)
- IM acceptable if no IV access (slower onset 5-10 min)
- Intranasal naloxone available (typically 4 mg dose) - slower, less predictable

**Post-naloxone care:**
- Continued monitoring minimum 2 hours (watch for re-sedation)
- Pain management challenge - multimodal non-opioids
- Investigate root cause (excessive opioid dose, drug interaction, renal/hepatic dysfunction)

**Documentation:**
- Respiratory depression event (vitals, timeline, interventions)
- Naloxone dose and patient response
- Provider notifications
- Transfer to higher level of care if indicated
- Incident report per institutional policy

### 11.3 Hemodynamic Instability

**Hemodynamic instability: Abnormal blood pressure or heart rate threatening organ perfusion**

**Common causes postoperative rTKA:**
- Hypovolemia (bleeding, inadequate resuscitation)
- Medication effects (anesthetics, opioids, antihypertensives)
- Pain (hypertension, tachycardia)
- Myocardial ischemia or infarction
- Arrhythmias
- Vasovagal response
- Sepsis (rare, later postoperative period)

### 11.4 Malignant Hyperthermia

**Malignant hyperthermia (MH): Rare, life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis triggered by volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine**

**Incidence:** ~1 in 100,000 anesthetics; higher in those with genetic predisposition

**Triggering agents:**
- Volatile anesthetics (sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane)
- Succinylcholine
- **NOT triggered by:** Propofol, opioids, benzodiazepines, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, local anesthetics, nitrous oxide

**Early signs (often first manifestations):**
- Unexplained tachycardia
- Tachypnea or increasing EtCO₂ (hypermetabolism producing CO₂)
- Masseter muscle rigidity (after succinylcholine - "cannot open mouth")
- Generalized muscle rigidity

**Progressive signs:**
- Rapidly rising EtCO₂ (>55 mmHg, increasing despite hyperventilation)
- Hyperthermia (may be late sign; temp rising >2°C/hour)
- Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis
- Hyperkalemia (K >6 mEq/L, can cause arrhythmias)
- Myoglobinuria (cola-colored urine)
- Arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation)
- Hypoxemia despite adequate ventilation
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

**Monitoring during suspected MH:**
- Continuous ECG (arrhythmias)
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Continuous capnography (trending EtCO₂)
- Continuous temperature (core temperature rising)
- Arterial blood gas (metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, PaCO₂)
- Frequent electrolytes (hyperkalemia life-threatening)
- CK (creatine kinase - massively elevated, can exceed 20,000)
- Myoglobin (serum and urine)
- Coagulation studies (DIC screening)
- Urine output (monitor for acute kidney injury from myoglobinuria)

**MH treatment protocol (IMMEDIATE):**

**1. Call for help and announce "Malignant Hyperthermia"**
- Activate MH protocol
- Assign roles (someone to mix dantrolene, someone to manage airway/ventilation, someone to call for help)
- Call for additional personnel

**2. Discontinue triggering agents IMMEDIATELY:**
- Turn off volatile anesthetics
- Switch to 100% oxygen
- Increase fresh gas flow to maximum (flush circuit)
- Change to non-triggering anesthetic (propofol TIVA)
- DO NOT delay treatment to change breathing circuit or CO₂ absorbent (can be done later if time permits)

**3. Hyperventilate:**
- Increase minute ventilation 2-3 times normal
- Goal: Reduce PaCO₂ and eliminate CO₂ produced by hypermetabolism
- 100% oxygen

**4. Administer dantrolene sodium IMMEDIATELY:**

**Dantrolene dosing:**
- **Initial dose: 2.5 mg/kg IV rapid push**
- **Repeat 1 mg/kg every 5 minutes until:**
  - Heart rate and EtCO₂ decreasing
  - Rigidity resolving
  - Temperature plateau or decreasing
- **Maximum initial dose:** May require 10 mg/kg or more in severe cases
- **Each vial:** 20 mg powder; reconstitute with 60 mL sterile water (takes ~5 min to dissolve)
- **Average adult may need 10-30 vials initially** - have adequate supply

**Dantrolene mixing:**
- Assign 2-3 people to mix dantrolene (time-consuming)
- Shake vigorously; powder difficult to dissolve
- Use large-bore IV for administration
- Continue mixing additional vials while giving initial doses

**5. Treat hyperkalemia:**
- Monitor K+ closely (can cause fatal arrhythmias)
- If K+ >6 mEq/L:
  - Calcium chloride 10 mg/kg IV (cardiac membrane stabilization)
  - Insulin 10 units IV + glucose 50 mL D50 IV (shift K+ intracellularly)
  - Hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis shifts K+ intracellularly)
  - Sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV if severe acidosis
  - **Avoid calcium channel blockers** (interaction with dantrolene can cause cardiovascular collapse)

**6. Treat arrhythmias:**
- Standard ACLS protocols
- **Avoid calcium channel blockers** (verapamil, diltiazem - contraindicated with dantrolene)
- Amiodarone acceptable if needed

**7. Active cooling:**
- Stop active warming devices
- Cold IV fluids (normal saline 4°C if available)
- Ice packs to groin, axilla, neck (large vessels)
- Lavage body cavities with cold saline if open (rare in TKA)
- Cooling blankets
- **Goal:** Reduce temperature to <38.5°C, then stop aggressive cooling (avoid hypothermia)

**8. Monitor and treat complications:**

**Acute kidney injury prevention:**
- Maintain urine output >2 mL/kg/hr
- Aggressive IV hydration
- Mannitol 0.25 g/kg IV (osmotic diuresis)
- Furosemide if needed
- Alkalinize urine (sodium bicarbonate) to prevent myoglobin precipitation
- Monitor for rhabdomyolysis (CK, myoglobin)

**Metabolic acidosis:**
- Sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV as needed
- Guided by arterial blood gas

**DIC:**
- Monitor coagulation studies
- Treat with blood products as needed (FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate)

**9. Continue dantrolene after acute episode:**
- **Post-crisis dantrolene:** 1 mg/kg IV every 4-6 hours for 24-48 hours
- Prevent recrudescence (MH can recur in 25% of cases)
- Oral dantrolene 1 mg/kg every 6 hours may be substituted after 24 hours

**10. ICU monitoring:**
- Transfer to ICU immediately
- Continuous monitoring (ECG, invasive BP, temperature, urine output)
- Serial labs (ABG, electrolytes, CK, myoglobin, coagulation studies)
- Monitor for recrudescence (recurrent hyperthermia, elevated EtCO₂)
- Continue dantrolene as above

# Patient Counseling Script

## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### Multimodal Anesthesia and Pain Management Options

---

## Purpose

This script provides a structured, patient-friendly way to explain the three anesthesia and pain-management options for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA):

1. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with nerve blocks (ACB + IPACK)
2. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) without nerve blocks
3. Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia

It is intended for preoperative counseling in clinic or pre-op holding. Language can be adapted to the patient's health literacy and local practice.

## 1. 60-Second Overview (If Time Is Limited)

"For your knee replacement, we'll keep you safe and comfortable while also planning how to control pain and help you recover quickly.

We use three main approaches:

- **One uses targeted nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines** to keep you comfortable and limit side effects like nausea or grogginess.
- **One uses the same non-opioid medicines but no nerve blocks**, which is simpler but may mean a bit more pain early on.
- **The third is a more traditional approach using opioids** like fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery, which works well but may cause more grogginess or nausea.

We'll also start pain control before surgery with medicines like acetaminophen and anti-inflammatories.

All three are safe. We'll talk through each option and decide together which fits your health, your history with medications, and your recovery goals."

### 2.1 Opening and Framing

"I'd like to spend a few minutes explaining how we'll manage your anesthesia and pain for your robot-assisted knee replacement.

Our goals are to:
- Keep you safe
- Keep you as comfortable as possible
- Help you wake up clearly
- Get you up and moving early to speed recovery

We now use what's called **multimodal anesthesia**. That means instead of relying on one drug like an opioid, we combine several approaches that work together."

### 2.2 Explaining the Three Options

#### Option 1: Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia WITH Nerve Blocks (ACB + IPACK)

"The first option, and the one we usually recommend, is:
- **Opioid-free anesthesia during surgery**, plus
- **Two targeted nerve blocks around the knee**: the adductor canal block and the IPACK block.

These blocks:
- Numb the front and back of the knee
- Preserve strength in your main leg muscles, helping with early walking
- Greatly reduce the need for opioids

The blocks take about 10-15 minutes and are done with ultrasound guidance, which helps ensure safety and accuracy.

During surgery, instead of opioids, we use:
- Low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine
- Acetaminophen
- An anti-inflammatory like celecoxib
- Dexamethasone to reduce pain and nausea

Most patients wake up:
- Comfortable or with only mild pain
- Less groggy
- With far less nausea

You can still receive a small dose of opioid later if you really need it, but the goal is to keep you comfortable without relying on them."

**Key phrases you may use:**
- "This is our preferred option for most patients."
- "It balances comfort with safety and faster recovery."
- "It's especially good for minimizing opioid exposure."

#### Option 2: Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia WITHOUT Nerve Blocks

"The second option uses the same non-opioid medicines, but without the nerve blocks.

In this approach:
- You still get acetaminophen, anti-inflammatories, dexamethasone, and low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine
- Instead of nerve blocks, the surgeon injects local anesthetic into the knee using a large-volume periarticular technique to numb the tissues

This option is helpful if:
- You prefer not to have nerve blocks
- Your blood thinner schedule means blocks are not ideal
- We need a simpler or faster workflow

Pain control is still good, but:
- The first 12-24 hours may be more uncomfortable compared to having blocks
- There is a slightly higher chance you may need a small amount of opioid in the recovery room"

**Key phrases you may use:**
- "This option still avoids opioids during surgery."
- "We keep opioids as a backup, not the main plan."

---

#### Option 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

"The third option is the traditional approach using opioid medicines during surgery, such as fentanyl or hydromorphone.

We still use many of the same non-opioid medicines, but we add opioids to help control pain or blood-pressure responses.

This option may be chosen if:
- You already take opioids regularly
- You have had good experiences with opioids before
- You prefer a more traditional approach
- Your medical history makes the non-opioid plan less optimal

Opioids work well, but they can cause:
- More nausea
- More sleepiness or grogginess
- Slower breathing, which we monitor closely
- Higher risk of falls or confusion, especially in older adults

We still use multimodal pain control afterward, but this option accepts a higher likelihood of needing opioids later."

**Key phrase you may use:**
- "This is a safe and familiar approach, with the tradeoff being more nausea or grogginess."

## 3. Shared Decision-Making

"There isn't a single right choice for everyone.

We look at:
- Your medical history
- Any daily opioids or blood thinners
- Any past problems with anesthesia
- Your goals — for example, minimizing opioids or avoiding nausea

Based on everything you've shared, my professional recommendation is:
**[Insert Option]**

How does that sound to you? Any concerns or preferences?"

**If patient agrees:**
"Great. We'll document that plan and keep backup options ready in case your body responds differently."

## 4. Key Reassurance Points

- "Nothing is locked in — we adjust based on your comfort."
- "Opioid-free does not mean denying pain relief."
- "Someone from anesthesia will be with you the entire time."
- "If you've had bad experiences before, tell me — we can plan around them."

## 5. Optional FAQ Snippets

**Q: Will I be awake?**

"No. You'll either be fully asleep or sedated with a spinal. You won't see or feel the surgery."

**Q: Will I wake up in pain?**

"We aim for mild, manageable discomfort. Many patients wake up with very little pain, especially with nerve blocks."

**Q: Why avoid opioids?**

"They can cause nausea, constipation, confusion, or dependence. Using less opioid usually means faster, safer recovery."

**Q: What if I still need opioids?**

"That's okay. OFIA simply means we don't use them routinely during surgery — but we absolutely use them if needed."

**Q: Are nerve blocks safe?**

"Yes — with ultrasound guidance, the risk of infection or nerve injury is very low (well under 1%)."

# Patient Counseling Script
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### Multimodal Anesthesia & Pain Management Options
### Version 1.4 — December 2025

---

## Purpose
This script supports patient-centered counseling for anesthesia and perioperative pain management options for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). It is designed to facilitate shared decision-making, align expectations, and support ERAS-style recovery goals.

Common pathway options include:
1. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with nerve blocks (ACB + IPACK)**
2. **OFIA without nerve blocks (block-free)**
3. **Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia**

**Key principle:** Opioids remain available as rescue analgesia in all pathways when clinically indicated.

# 1. 60-Second Overview (Time-Limited)
_“For your knee replacement, our goals are to keep you safe, control pain effectively, and help you recover quickly.”_

_“We use a multimodal approach—several medications and techniques working together—so we don’t rely on opioids alone.”_

_“There are three common options: one uses nerve blocks plus opioid-free anesthesia, one avoids nerve blocks but still minimizes opioids during surgery, and one uses traditional opioid medicines during surgery.”_

_“We will decide together based on your medical history, preferences, and recovery goals.”_

# 2. Full Counseling Script

## 2.1 Opening and Framing
_“I’d like to spend a few minutes reviewing how we will manage anesthesia and pain control for your knee replacement.”_

_“Our goals are safety, comfort, a clear wake-up, low nausea, and supporting early mobility.”_

_“We tailor the plan to you. We also keep backup options available, including opioids if needed.”_

---

## 2.2 Explaining the Three Pathways

---

## Option 1 — OFIA WITH ACB + IPACK Nerve Blocks (Preferred When Safe/Feasible)
_“The first option, and the one we often prefer when it’s safe and you’re comfortable with it, uses two ultrasound-guided nerve blocks plus an opioid-minimizing or opioid-free anesthetic during surgery.”_

**What the blocks do:**
- Reduce pain from the front and back of the knee
- Preserve quadriceps strength (ACB is designed to be motor-sparing)
- Reduce the need for opioids after surgery
- Often last **about 12–18 hours** (varies by patient and local anesthetic)
- Support early ambulation and physical therapy participation

**What to expect during block placement:**
- Ultrasound-guided, typically takes **~10–15 minutes**
- You remain monitored throughout
- We can use comfort measures and, when appropriate, a small dose of a relaxing medication to reduce anxiety

**When blocks may not be recommended:**
- Certain blood thinner timing / bleeding-risk considerations
- Infection near the injection site
- Specific anatomic considerations or prior technical difficulty

**Your overall perioperative plan may include:**
- Non-opioid anesthetic strategy during surgery (OFIA framework)
- Adjuncts such as low-dose ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine when appropriate
- Standard ERAS medications (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAID if safe, anti-nausea prophylaxis)

**Expected recovery profile (typical):**
- Less sharp pain early on; more pressure/tightness than severe pain
- Lower nausea risk compared with opioid-heavy approaches
- More clear-headed wake-up for many patients
- Earlier readiness for mobility

_“If you still need opioids afterward, we will use them. In this approach they are backup—not the primary plan.”_

---

## Option 2 — OFIA WITHOUT Nerve Blocks (Block-Free)
_“The second option avoids nerve block injections from anesthesia, while still using an opioid-minimizing or opioid-free approach during surgery.”_

**What it means:**
- No ACB/IPACK blocks
- The surgeon typically injects local anesthetic around the knee during the operation
- Pain control relies more on systemic multimodal medications

**When this option is often chosen:**
- Preference to avoid nerve block injections
- Anticoagulation timing or bleeding-risk considerations
- Technical/anatomic considerations
- Workflow considerations when block setup is not feasible

**Pain expectations (typical):**
- Good overall control, but **higher pain risk in the first 12–24 hours** compared with blocks
- Some patients may need small rescue opioid doses in PACU or early post-op

_“This option is simpler and avoids block injections, while still keeping opioids as a backup if needed.”_

---

## Option 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia
_“The third option is a traditional approach that includes opioid medications such as fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery.”_

**When this approach may be chosen:**
- Chronic opioid use or high opioid tolerance
- Contraindications to key OFIA adjuncts
- Patient preference
- Situations where the clinical team believes an opioid-inclusive plan is the safest fit

**Advantages:**
- Familiar and widely used approach
- Effective analgesia when carefully titrated

**Tradeoffs (higher probability than OFIA approaches):**
- Nausea/vomiting
- Sedation/grogginess
- Constipation
- Breathing suppression risk, especially in OSA or frail/older adults
- Delirium risk in older adults (multifactorial; sedation is a contributor)

_“This option can be very safe, but it tends to have more side effects for some patients.”_

---

# 3. Shared Decision-Making
_“There isn’t one option that fits everyone. We consider your medical history, comfort with injections, sensitivity to nausea, sleep apnea risk, and how quickly you want to mobilize.”_

_“Based on what you’ve told me, I recommend: **[Insert Option]**. How does that sound?”_

If patient agrees:
_“Great. We’ll document your preference and keep backup options ready. We can adapt the plan if anything changes.”_

If hesitant:
_“Tell me what concerns you most—pain, nausea, injections, waking up groggy—and we’ll tailor the plan.”_

---

# 4. Key Reassurance Points
- _“We personalize the plan based on your health and preferences.”_
- _“Opioid-free does not mean withholding pain treatment.”_
- _“We always keep rescue options available—including opioids if needed.”_
- _“You are continuously monitored, and anesthesia is present throughout.”_
- _“If you’ve had a prior bad experience (nausea, grogginess, difficult airway), we plan around it.”_

# 5. Optional FAQ (Patient-Friendly)

**Q: Will I be awake?**  
_“Most patients are fully asleep. In some cases, patients may have spinal anesthesia with sedation; we’ll discuss what fits you best.”_

**Q: Will I wake up in pain?**  
_“Our goal is mild, manageable discomfort. Nerve blocks often reduce early pain significantly.”_

**Q: Why try to minimize opioids?**  
_“They can cause nausea, constipation, and slow breathing. Using less often supports a clearer wake-up and faster recovery.”_

**Q: What if I need opioids?**  
_“You will receive them if needed. We do not withhold pain treatment.”_

**Q: Are nerve blocks safe?**  
_“Yes. They are ultrasound-guided. Complications are uncommon, and we monitor for them and are prepared to treat them.”_

**Q: What is midazolam?**  
_“A short-acting relaxing medicine that can reduce anxiety. In some patients it can also reduce memory of stressful moments.”_

**Q: How long do blocks last?**  
_“Often around 12–18 hours, but it varies. We plan your oral medications so you stay comfortable as blocks wear off.”_

# 7. Special Population Considerations (Short Add-Ons)

### Frail / Older Adults
- Emphasize delirium risk reduction strategies, opioid minimization when appropriate, and early mobility goals
- State that sedatives (including benzodiazepines) are used conservatively and may be minimized/avoided

### OSA
- Emphasize minimizing respiratory depressants, postoperative monitoring, and CPAP/BiPAP plan

### Chronic Opioid Users
- Set expectations: baseline tolerance may increase analgesic needs
- Reinforce multimodal strategy; blocks may still provide meaningful benefit
- Continue baseline regimen per institutional policy

### High Anxiety / Needle Aversion
- Offer block-free pathway discussion
- Emphasize comfort measures, pacing, and time for questions

# Patient Counseling Script  
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)  
### Multimodal Anesthesia and Pain Management Options  
### Version 1.2 — December 8, 2025

---

## Purpose

This script provides a structured, patient-friendly framework to explain the **three anesthesia and pain-management options** used in this project for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA):

1. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with ACB + IPACK blocks**  
2. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) without nerve blocks** (block-free, with surgeon periarticular infiltration)  
3. **Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia**

It is intended for preoperative counseling in clinic or in the pre-op holding area. Wording should be adapted to the patient’s health literacy, anxiety level, and local practice norms.

## 1. 60-Second Overview (If Time Is Limited)

> “For your knee replacement, we will plan both your anesthesia and your pain control so that you’re safe, comfortable, and able to start moving early after surgery.

> We have three main approaches:

> - One uses **targeted nerve blocks and non-opioid medications** to keep you comfortable and reduce side effects like nausea or grogginess.  
> - One uses the **same non-opioid medications but without nerve blocks**, which is simpler and avoids leg injections, but may mean a bit more pain early on.  
> - The third is a **more traditional approach using opioid pain medications** such as fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery, which works well but can cause more nausea, sleepiness, and constipation.

> In all three options, we start pain control **before** surgery with medicines like acetaminophen and anti-inflammatories. We also usually give a small dose of a relaxing medicine called **midazolam** to help with anxiety.

> All three approaches are safe. I’ll explain the options, and together we’ll decide which best fits your health, your past experiences with medicines, and your recovery goals.”

## 2. Full Counseling Script

### 2.1 Opening and Framing

> “I’d like to spend a few minutes explaining how we’ll manage your anesthesia and pain for your robot-assisted knee replacement.

Our goals are to:

- Keep you **safe**  
- Keep you **as comfortable as possible**  
- Help you **wake up clearly** and avoid confusion  
- Get you **up and walking early** to speed recovery

We use what’s called **multimodal anesthesia** and analgesia. That means instead of relying mainly on strong opioids, we combine different approaches that work together: nerve blocks, non-opioid medicines, and, when needed, small amounts of opioids.”

---

### 2.2 Explaining the Three Options

#### Option 1: Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia WITH Nerve Blocks (ACB + IPACK)

> “The first option, and the one we **usually recommend** for most patients, is:
> - **Opioid-free anesthesia during surgery**, plus  
> - **Two targeted nerve blocks** around the knee: the **adductor canal block** and the **IPACK block**.

These blocks:

- Numb the **front and back** of the knee  
- **Preserve leg strength**, so your thigh muscles still work for walking  
- Greatly **reduce your need for opioids**  
- Typically last about **12–18 hours** after surgery

We do the blocks with ultrasound guidance. They usually take about 10–15 minutes. Before we start, we give a small dose of **midazolam** through your IV to help you relax and not remember the block placement.

During surgery, instead of opioids, we use:

- **Acetaminophen** (Tylenol-type medicine)  
- **Anti-inflammatory medication** like celecoxib  
- **Dexamethasone**, a steroid that helps reduce pain and nausea  
- **Ketamine** in low doses for pain control  
- **Dexmedetomidine**, which helps with comfort and decreases the need for opioids  
- **Midazolam** to help with anxiety and amnesia

Most patients with this plan wake up:

- With **none to mild pain**, or a dull ache rather than severe pain  
- **Less groggy**  
- With **less nausea**  
- Able to **move and lift the leg** because the main muscle strength is preserved

If you do need more pain relief later, we can still give **small doses of opioid** medicines. The goal is not to deny opioids, but to **make them our backup**, not the main tool.”

**Key phrases you can use:**

- “This is our **preferred option** for most patients.”  
- “It balances comfort, safety, and a **faster recovery**.”  
- “It is especially good for **minimizing opioid exposure** and nausea.”  
- “The blocks wear off gradually over 12–18 hours, and by then your scheduled pain medicines are working well.”

---

#### Option 2: Opioid-Free Anesthesia WITHOUT Nerve Blocks  
*(“No Needle Pokes from Anesthesia”)*

> “The second option uses all the same **non-opioid medicines**, but **without any nerve block injections**. That means **no extra injections into your leg from the anesthesia team** before surgery.

Here is what that means in practical terms:

- No nerve block injections into the leg  
- No additional needle sticks from anesthesia other than your IV  
- All medications are given through your **single IV line**  
- You still receive the relaxing medicine (**midazolam**) through your IV  
- While you are fully asleep, the **surgeon** injects local anesthetic directly around your knee joint to help with pain

With this plan:

- You still receive acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory medication, dexamethasone, midazolam, and low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine  
- There are **no ultrasound-guided nerve blocks**  
- Pain control comes from:
  - Your pre-operative medications  
  - The non-opioid anesthesia medicines  
  - The surgeon’s **periarticular local anesthetic injection** after you are asleep

This plan is **simpler** and avoids extra leg injections before surgery, while still keeping the anesthesia itself **opioid-free**.”

**Why choose this option?**

“This approach can be a good fit if:

- You strongly prefer **no nerve block injections**  
- You have **needle anxiety** and want to avoid additional pokes  
- Your **blood thinner schedule** makes blocks less ideal  
- We need to move quickly and avoid extra setup time for blocks  
- Your anatomy or prior surgery makes nerve blocks more technically difficult”

**Pain expectations**

“With this option:

- Pain control is still generally good, but the first **12–24 hours** may be a bit more uncomfortable than with nerve blocks  
- You may be **more likely to request pain medicine in the recovery room**  
- The surgeon’s injection helps but does not last as long as nerve blocks

Again, opioids remain available as a **backup**, not as the primary plan.”

**Key phrases you can use:**

- “No extra needle pokes from anesthesia — everything is done through your IV.”  
- “The only additional injection is done by the surgeon while you are fully asleep.”  
- “This option is still **opioid-free during surgery**.”  
- “We still keep opioids available if you need them.”

---

#### Option 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

> “The third option is the **traditional** approach using opioid medicines such as fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery.

We still use many of the **same non-opioid medicines**:

- Acetaminophen  
- Anti-inflammatory medication  
- Dexamethasone  
- Midazolam to help with relaxation

But we **add opioids** during surgery to help control pain responses and blood pressure.

We often choose this option when:

- You already take opioids regularly for chronic pain  
- You’ve done well with opioids in the past and prefer that approach  
- Your medical history makes OFIA medications less optimal  
- You specifically request a more traditional plan after understanding the pros and cons  

Opioids are effective pain medications, but they come with tradeoffs:

- **More nausea and vomiting**  
- **More sleepiness or grogginess**  
- **Slower breathing**, which we monitor closely  
- **Higher risk of confusion or delirium**, especially in older adults  
- **Constipation** and longer recovery for bowel function

We still use a multimodal plan after surgery, but with this option we accept a **higher likelihood of needing opioids** in the recovery room and on the floor.”

**Key phrases you can use:**

- “This is a **safe and familiar** approach that many people have had.”  
- “The tradeoff is usually **more nausea and grogginess** and a bit more risk of breathing or confusion issues.”  
- “We monitor you very closely when using opioids.”

## 3. Shared Decision-Making

> “There isn’t a single ‘right’ choice for everyone.”

When you summarize:

“We consider:

- Your **medical history** (heart, lungs, kidneys, sleep apnea)  
- Whether you **take opioids regularly** now  
- Any previous problems with anesthesia or pain medicines  
- How you feel about **needles and nerve blocks**  
- Your recovery goals — minimizing opioids, avoiding nausea, or getting home quickly

Based on what you’ve told me, my professional recommendation is:  
**[Insert Option 1 / 2 / 3]**

How does that sound to you? Any concerns or preferences?”

**If patient agrees:**

> “Great. We’ll document that plan and also keep flexible backup options. Anesthesia is adjustable — we will respond to how your body actually behaves during and after surgery.”

**If patient hesitates:**

> “What concerns you most? Let’s talk through that — I want you to feel comfortable and confident about the plan.”

## 4. Key Reassurance Points

You may reinforce:

- “Nothing is locked in — we adjust the plan based on your comfort and how you respond.”  
- “‘Opioid-free’ does **not** mean you’ll be left in pain; it means we use other tools first.”  
- “Someone from anesthesia is with you the **entire time**, continually watching your breathing, heart rate, and comfort.”  
- “If you’ve had bad experiences in the past, please tell us — we can plan around them.”  
- “The relaxing medicine, **midazolam**, is very commonly used; it helps with anxiety and you may not remember the nerve block placement.”

## 5. Optional FAQ Snippets

**Q: Will I be awake during surgery?**  
> “No. You will either be fully asleep with general anesthesia or numb from the waist down with a spinal plus sedation. In both cases, you won’t see, hear, or feel the surgery.”

**Q: Will I wake up in pain?**  
> “Our goal is for you to wake up with **mild, manageable discomfort** at most. With nerve blocks, many patients report very little pain initially.”

**Q: Why avoid opioids if they work well?**  
> “They do work for pain, but they also cause nausea, constipation, grogginess, and sometimes confusion or breathing problems. Using less opioid usually means a **safer, smoother recovery**.”

**Q: What if I still need opioids?**  
> “Then we use them. OFIA means we **do not rely on opioids during surgery** as our main tool, but they are always available when needed. Your comfort is still a priority.”

**Q: Are nerve blocks safe?**  
> “Yes. With ultrasound guidance, serious risks like infection, bleeding, or permanent nerve injury are **very rare**. We do these blocks frequently and monitor carefully.”

**Q: What is midazolam? Is it safe?**  
> “Midazolam is a short-acting relaxing medicine. It reduces anxiety and usually makes you forget the most stressful parts. It is very commonly used and wears off over a few hours.”

**Q: Can I choose spinal instead of general anesthesia?**  
> “Often yes. Spinal anesthesia can let you avoid a breathing tube and can reduce nausea or grogginess. We can discuss whether spinal is appropriate in your case.”

**Q: What if the blocks don’t work?**  
> “We always have backup plans — additional non-opioid medicines and opioids if needed. We reassess your pain often and adjust.”

**Q: How long do the nerve blocks last?**  
> “They typically last **12–18 hours**. As they start to wear off, you’ll already be on scheduled oral pain medicines to smooth the transition.”

## 7. Special Population Considerations

### Elderly or Frail Patients
- Emphasize lower delirium risk with **opioid-sparing/OFIA** approaches  
- Discuss fall risk and sedation with opioids  
- Highlight **quad-sparing ACB** for safer early mobilization  

### Patients with OSA
- Emphasize **avoiding respiratory depression** with OFIA  
- Explain increased sensitivity to opioids  
- Reassure about continuous postoperative monitoring  

### Chronic Opioid Users
- Acknowledge tolerance and likely higher pain needs  
- Set realistic pain expectations (goal = tolerable, not zero pain)  
- Discuss when **conventional opioid-inclusive** pathway may be more appropriate, while still using multimodal adjuncts  

### Highly Anxious Patients
- Emphasize the role of **midazolam** and careful, stepwise explanation  
- Allow more time for questions and preferences  
- Consider preoperative anxiolytic strategies per local policy

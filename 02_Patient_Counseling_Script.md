# Patient Counseling Script

## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### Multimodal Anesthesia and Pain Management Options
### Version 1.1 — December 7, 2025

---

## Purpose

This script provides a structured, patient-friendly way to explain the three anesthesia and pain-management options for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA):

1. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with nerve blocks (ACB + IPACK)
2. Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) without nerve blocks
3. Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia

It is intended for preoperative counseling in clinic or pre-op holding. Language can be adapted to the patient's health literacy and local practice.

## 1. 60-Second Overview (If Time Is Limited)

"For your knee replacement, we'll keep you safe and comfortable while also planning how to control pain and help you recover quickly.

We use three main approaches:

- **One uses targeted nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines** to keep you comfortable and limit side effects like nausea or grogginess.
- **One uses the same non-opioid medicines but no nerve blocks**, which is simpler but may mean a bit more pain early on.
- **The third is a more traditional approach using opioids** like fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery, which works well but may cause more grogginess or nausea.

We'll also start pain control before surgery with medicines like acetaminophen and anti-inflammatories. We'll give you a mild relaxing medicine called midazolam to help with anxiety.

All three are safe. We'll talk through each option and decide together which fits your health, your history with medications, and your recovery goals."

### 2.1 Opening and Framing

"I'd like to spend a few minutes explaining how we'll manage your anesthesia and pain for your robot-assisted knee replacement.

Our goals are to:
- Keep you safe
- Keep you as comfortable as possible
- Help you wake up clearly
- Get you up and moving early to speed recovery

We now use what's called **multimodal anesthesia**. That means instead of relying on one drug like an opioid, we combine several approaches that work together."

### 2.2 Explaining the Three Options

#### Option 1: Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia WITH Nerve Blocks (ACB + IPACK)

"The first option, and the one we usually recommend, is:
- **Opioid-free anesthesia during surgery**, plus
- **Two targeted nerve blocks around the knee**: the adductor canal block and the IPACK block.

These blocks:
- Numb the front and back of the knee
- Preserve strength in your main leg muscles, helping with early walking
- Greatly reduce the need for opioids
- Last for 12-18 hours after surgery

The blocks take about 10-15 minutes and are done with ultrasound guidance, which helps ensure safety and accuracy. We'll give you a mild relaxing medicine (midazolam) beforehand to help you feel comfortable.

During surgery, instead of opioids, we use:
- Low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine (these are safe medications that help with pain and comfort)
- Acetaminophen (like Tylenol)
- An anti-inflammatory like celecoxib (like Celebrex)
- Dexamethasone (a steroid to reduce pain and nausea)
- Midazolam (a mild relaxing medicine for anxiety)

Most patients wake up:
- Comfortable or with only mild pain
- Less groggy
- With far less nausea
- Able to move their leg muscles normally

You can still receive a small dose of opioid later if you really need it, but the goal is to keep you comfortable without relying on them."

**Key phrases you may use:**
- "This is our preferred option for most patients."
- "It balances comfort with safety and faster recovery."
- "It's especially good for minimizing opioid exposure."
- "The blocks wear off gradually over 12-18 hours, and by then your other pain medicines are working well."

---

#### Option 2: Opioid-Free Anesthesia Without Nerve Blocks (No Needle Pokes From Anesthesia)

"Your second option uses all the same non-opioid medicines, but without any nerve block injections. This means **you will not receive any needle pokes from the anesthesia team** before surgery.

Here's exactly what that means:
- No nerve block injections
- No needles into the leg from anesthesia
- No injections while you're awake (except the single IV we place)
- All IV medicines go through the single IV line you already have
- You'll still get the mild relaxing medicine (midazolam) through your IV

Instead, after you are fully asleep, the surgeon places a large-volume local anesthetic injection directly inside the knee joint to help with early pain control. You will not be awake for this injection, and you will not feel it."

**Clinical Description**

"With this plan:
- You still get acetaminophen, anti-inflammatories, dexamethasone, midazolam, and low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine
- There are no nerve blocks, so no ultrasound-guided injections
- Pain control comes from:
  - Your pre-operative medications
  - The non-opioid anesthesia medicines
  - The surgeon's injection after you're asleep

This is a simpler plan that completely avoids any extra needles before surgery."

**Why Choose This Option?**

"This approach is helpful if:
- You prefer not to have any nerve block injections
- You're anxious about needles and want to avoid extra pokes
- Your blood thinner schedule makes blocks less ideal
- We want a simpler workflow that still avoids opioids during surgery
- You have anatomical reasons that make blocks more difficult"

**Pain Expectations**

"Pain control is still good with this option, but:
- The first 12-24 hours may be a little more uncomfortable than with nerve blocks
- You might be more likely to request a small amount of pain medication in the recovery room
- The surgeon's injection helps but doesn't last as long as nerve blocks

But again — we keep opioid-based analgesia as a backup, not the main plan."

**Key phrases you may use:**
- "No needle pokes from anesthesia at all — everything is done through your IV."
- "The only injection is done by the surgeon after you are completely asleep."
- "This option still keeps you opioid-free during surgery."
- "We will still keep opioids available if you need them — but they're a backup, not the plan."

---

#### Option 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

"The third option is the traditional approach using opioid medicines during surgery, such as fentanyl or hydromorphone.

We still use many of the same non-opioid medicines, including:
- Acetaminophen
- Anti-inflammatories
- Dexamethasone
- Midazolam for relaxation

But we add opioids to help control pain or blood-pressure responses during surgery.

This option may be chosen if:
- You already take opioids regularly for chronic pain
- You have had good experiences with opioids before
- You prefer a more traditional approach
- Your medical history makes the non-opioid plan less optimal
- You specifically request this approach

Opioids work well for pain, but they can cause:
- More nausea and vomiting
- More sleepiness or grogginess
- Slower breathing, which we monitor closely
- Higher risk of falls or confusion, especially in older adults
- Constipation

We still use multimodal pain control afterward, but this option accepts a higher likelihood of needing opioids in the recovery room and on the hospital floor."

**Key phrase you may use:**
- "This is a safe and familiar approach, with the tradeoff being more nausea or grogginess."
- "We monitor you very closely when using opioids to ensure safety."

## 3. Shared Decision-Making

"There isn't a single right choice for everyone.

We look at:
- Your medical history (heart, lungs, kidneys)
- Any daily opioids or blood thinners you take
- Any past problems with anesthesia (nausea, confusion, breathing problems)
- Your anxiety level about needles or procedures
- Your goals — for example, minimizing opioids, avoiding nausea, or getting home quickly

Based on everything you've shared, my professional recommendation is:
**[Insert Option]**

How does that sound to you? Any concerns or preferences?"

**If patient agrees:**
"Great. We'll document that plan and keep backup options ready in case your body responds differently than expected. Anesthesia is flexible — we adjust to your needs."

**If patient hesitates:**
"What concerns you most? Let's talk through it — I want you to feel confident about the plan."

---

## 4. Key Reassurance Points

- "Nothing is locked in — we adjust based on your comfort and how you respond."
- "Opioid-free does not mean denying pain relief — we have many effective options."
- "Someone from anesthesia will be with you the entire time monitoring your safety."
- "If you've had bad experiences before with anesthesia or pain medicines, tell me — we can plan around them."
- "The relaxing medicine (midazolam) we give is very safe and commonly used — it just helps take the edge off anxiety."
- "You won't remember the nerve blocks if we do them — the midazolam creates amnesia for that part."

## 5. Optional FAQ Snippets

**Q: Will I be awake during surgery?**

"No. You'll either be fully asleep with general anesthesia or sedated with a spinal anesthetic. Either way, you won't see or feel the surgery."

**Q: Will I wake up in pain?**

"We aim for mild, manageable discomfort. Many patients wake up with very little pain, especially with nerve blocks. Some describe it as a dull ache or pressure rather than sharp pain."

**Q: Why avoid opioids if they work?**

"They can cause nausea, constipation, confusion, or dependence. Using less opioid usually means faster, safer recovery and less risk of side effects. The research shows that nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines work just as well for most patients."

**Q: What if I still need opioids?**

"That's okay. OFIA simply means we don't use them routinely during surgery — but we absolutely use them if needed. Think of opioids as our backup plan, not our first choice."

**Q: Are nerve blocks safe?**

"Yes — with ultrasound guidance, the risk of serious complications like infection or nerve injury is very low (well under 1%). We do thousands of these safely every year."

**Q: What is midazolam? Is it safe?**

"Midazolam is a mild relaxing medicine in the same family as Valium or Ativan. It helps with anxiety and creates some amnesia so you don't remember stressful parts of the procedure. It's very safe and commonly used. It wears off quickly and doesn't interfere with your recovery."

**Q: Can I choose spinal instead of general anesthesia?**

"In many cases, yes! We can discuss spinal anesthesia, which numbs you from the waist down while you're awake or lightly sedated. Many patients prefer this because they wake up less groggy."

**Q: What if the blocks don't work?**

"That's rare but possible. If the blocks don't provide enough pain relief, we have several backup options including IV ketamine and opioids as needed. We monitor you closely and adjust."

**Q: How long do the nerve blocks last?**

"Typically 12-18 hours. By the time they wear off, you'll be on scheduled oral pain medicines that keep you comfortable."

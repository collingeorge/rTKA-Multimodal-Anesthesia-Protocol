# Patient Counseling Script  
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)  
### Multimodal Anesthesia & Pain Management Options  
### Version 1.2 — December 2025  

---

## Purpose  
This script provides a structured, patient-friendly framework for discussing anesthesia and pain-management pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). It supports shared decision-making, expectation setting, and ERAS-aligned care.  

Anesthesia options include:

1. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) with nerve blocks (ACB + IPACK)**  
2. **Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) without nerve blocks**  
3. **Conventional opioid-inclusive anesthesia**

# 1. 60-Second Overview (Use When Time Is Limited)

**_“For your knee replacement, our goals are to keep you safe, control your pain effectively, and help you recover quickly.”_**

**_“We use three approaches: one with nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines, one without blocks but still opioid-free, and one that uses traditional opioid medicines during surgery.”_**

**_“All three are safe. We will decide together which option best matches your medical history, comfort level, and recovery goals.”_**

---

# 2. Full Counseling Script  

## 2.1 Opening and Framing

**_“I’d like to spend a few minutes reviewing how we will manage your anesthesia and pain for your knee replacement.”_**

**_“Our goals are to keep you safe, keep you comfortable, help you wake up clearly, and support early mobility.”_**

**_“We use a multimodal approach, meaning several different medications work together so we do not rely on opioids alone.”_**

---

## 2.2 Explaining the Three Pathways  

---

## **Option 1 — OFIA WITH ACB + IPACK Nerve Blocks (Preferred ERAS Pathway)**  

**_“The first option, and the one we typically recommend, uses two targeted nerve blocks plus non-opioid anesthesia.”_**

These blocks:  
- Numb the front and back of the knee  
- Preserve quadriceps strength (ACB is motor-sparing)  
- Greatly reduce opioid requirements  
- Last **12–18 hours**  
- Facilitate early ambulation  

Blocks are ultrasound-guided and take **10–15 minutes**. Midazolam is used for anxiolysis and amnesia.

Intraoperative medications (opioid-free):  
- Low-dose ketamine  
- Dexmedetomidine  
- Acetaminophen  
- NSAID (celecoxib or meloxicam)  
- Dexamethasone  
- Midazolam  

Expected wake-up:  
- Mild pain or pressure rather than sharp pain  
- Low nausea risk  
- Clear-headed emergence  
- Early ability to participate in mobility

**_“You can still receive opioids if you need them, but they are a backup—not the main plan.”_**

---

## **Option 2 — OFIA WITHOUT Nerve Blocks (No Needle Pokes From Anesthesia)**  

**_“Your second option keeps the anesthesia opioid-free but avoids nerve block injections entirely.”_**

Meaning:  
- No ACB/IPACK blocks  
- No needle pokes from anesthesia except the IV  
- Surgeon performs a large-volume local anesthetic injection **after you are asleep**  
- All other analgesia is systemic and multimodal  

This option is appropriate for:  
- Needle aversion or anxiety  
- Anticoagulation schedules that restrict blocks  
- Anatomical considerations  
- Faster workflow with fewer procedures  

Pain expectations:  
- Good overall control  
- Slightly higher pain in first **12–24 hours**  
- May require small opioid doses in PACU  

**_“This is a simpler plan that avoids extra injections while still allowing an opioid-free anesthetic.”_**

---

## **Option 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia**  

**_“The third option is the traditional approach using opioid medications like fentanyl or hydromorphone during surgery.”_**

This is often chosen for:  
- Chronic opioid users  
- Severe preoperative anxiety  
- Contraindications to OFIA medications  
- Patient preference for traditional anesthesia  

Advantages:  
- Familiar approach  
- Effective analgesia  

Tradeoffs:  
- More nausea  
- More sedation / grogginess  
- Higher respiratory risk (especially in OSA)  
- Higher fall risk  
- Constipation  

**_“This is a safe and familiar option, but it has higher side-effect potential.”_**

---

# 3. Shared Decision-Making  

**_“There isn’t one option that fits everyone. We look at your health, comfort with injections, sensitivity to opioids, and recovery goals.”_**

**_“Based on what you’ve told me, I recommend: [Insert Option]. How does that sound to you?”_**

If patient agrees:  
**_“Great. We’ll document that and keep backup options ready. Anesthesia is flexible—we adjust to your needs.”_**

If hesitant:  
**_“Tell me what concerns you. We can walk through everything together.”_**

---

# 4. Key Reassurance Points  

- **_“Nothing is locked in—we adjust based on how you feel.”_**  
- **_“Opioid-free does not mean withholding pain treatment.”_**  
- **_“You will not remember the nerve block procedure if we perform blocks.”_**  
- **_“Someone from anesthesia stays with you the entire time.”_**  
- **_“If you’ve had bad experiences before, we can plan around them.”_**  
- **_“We always keep rescue options—opioids included—available if needed.”_**

# 5. Optional FAQ (Patient-Friendly Responses)

**Q: Will I be awake?**  
**_“No. You will either be fully asleep or comfortably sedated.”_**

**Q: Will I wake up in pain?**  
**_“Our goal is mild, manageable discomfort. Blocks help significantly.”_**

**Q: Why avoid opioids?**  
**_“They can cause nausea, grogginess, breathing issues, and constipation. Using less generally means faster recovery.”_**

**Q: What if I need opioids?**  
**_“We will absolutely give them if needed. OFIA does not mean ‘no pain medicine.’”_**

**Q: Are nerve blocks safe?**  
**_“Yes. Ultrasound guidance makes serious complications very rare.”_**

**Q: What is midazolam?**  
**_“A mild relaxing medicine that helps with anxiety and creates amnesia for stressful moments.”_**

**Q: How long do blocks last?**  
**_“Typically 12–18 hours, giving your other medications time to work before they wear off.”_**

# 6. Documentation Prompts  

You should document that you:  
- Discussed all **three** anesthesia pathways  
- Reviewed risks/benefits/alternatives  
- Answered patient questions  
- Documented patient preference  
- Documented clinical recommendation + rationale  
- Obtained consent for blocks (if applicable)  
- Explained midazolam and standard medications  

**Example Chart Note:**  

**“Patient counseled on three anesthesia pathways for rTKA: (1) OFIA with ACB/IPACK, (2) OFIA without blocks, (3) conventional opioid-based anesthesia. Discussed risks/benefits including PONV, sedation, respiratory depression, and block risks. Patient prefers [option]. Recommendation: [option] based on [clinical rationale]. All questions answered. Informed consent obtained.”**

# 7. Special Population Considerations

### Elderly or Frail  
- Emphasize delirium reduction with OFIA  
- Discuss fall-risk mitigation  
- Highlight motor-sparing benefits of ACB  

### OSA  
- Emphasize reduced respiratory depression risk with OFIA  
- Discuss postoperative monitoring  

### Chronic Opioid Users  
- Set realistic expectations  
- Consider leaning to conventional pathway  
- Reinforce multimodal strategies  

### Anxious Patients  
- Emphasize midazolam’s anxiolysis  
- Allow extra time for questions  
- Consider night-before anxiolytic per physician

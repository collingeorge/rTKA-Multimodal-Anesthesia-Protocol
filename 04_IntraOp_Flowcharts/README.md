# Intraoperative Decision Flowcharts  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This directory contains text-based intraoperative decision algorithms that support standardized, evidence-aligned anesthesia management for rTKA. These flowcharts complement the detailed protocol documents in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/` and are designed for quick reference at the point of care.

## Directory Contents

1. **Spinal vs General Anesthesia Decision Algorithm**  
   **File:** `Spinal_vs_GA_Decision.md`  
   - Text-based decision pathway for selecting spinal vs general anesthesia in rTKA.  
   - Integrates patient factors (comorbidities, anticoagulation, anatomy), surgeon preference, and workflow considerations.  
   - Aligned with ASRA 2024–2025 and ERAS Society recommendations.

2. **PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm**  
   **File:** `PACU_Pain_Rescue_Algorithm.md`  
   - Stepwise approach to PACU pain assessment and rescue therapy.  
   - Harmonized with the three primary anesthesia pathways:  
     - OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
     - OFIA Block-Free  
     - Conventional opioid-based anesthesia  
   - Emphasizes multimodal rescue and opioid stewardship.

## Intended Use

- Educational reference for anesthesia trainees and residents.  
- Quick decision support for attendings, CRNAs, and PACU staff.  
- Binder-ready and EMR-friendly (can be adapted into institutional order sets or checklists).

These flowcharts do **not** replace clinical judgment or institutional policy. They must be reviewed and adapted by supervising anesthesiologists prior to clinical implementation.

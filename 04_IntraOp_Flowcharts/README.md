# Intraoperative Decision Flowcharts  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This directory contains standardized, evidence-based intraoperative decision algorithms that support safe, reproducible anesthesia care for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). These flowcharts function as quick-reference operational tools and are clinically aligned with the full anesthesia protocols in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/`.

The flowcharts emphasize clarity, cognitive unloading, and attending-level decision pathways suitable for anesthesia clinicians at all levels.

## Directory Contents

### 1. **Spinal vs General Anesthesia Decision Algorithm**  
**File:** `Spinal_vs_GA_Decision.md`

A structured decision pathway for selecting spinal versus general anesthesia, integrating:

- Patient comorbidities, functional status, and frailty  
- Anticoagulation timing per **ASRA 2024–2025 guidelines**  
- Airway and anatomical considerations  
- Surgeon preference and workflow efficiency  
- Expected postoperative mobility requirements  

Guidance reflects ERAS Society recommendations and standard anxiolysis with **midazolam 1–2 mg IV**, which remains compatible with OFIA pathways.

### 2. **PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm**  
**File:** `PACU_Pain_Rescue_Algorithm.md`

A stepwise, PACU-focused rescue sequence aligned with the three core pathways:

- **OFIA with ACB/IPACK**  
- **OFIA – Block-Free**  
- **Conventional Opioid-Based**

The flowchart emphasizes:

- First-line non-opioid rescue (ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV)  
- Opioid stewardship with cautious titration  
- Special population modifications (elderly, frail, OSA, opioid-tolerant)  
- Integration with rTKA ERAS protocols for early mobilization

## Core Clinical Principles Across All Flowcharts

### **1. Midazolam for Anxiolysis**
- **1–2 mg IV midazolam** is standard pre-induction anxiolysis and does **not** conflict with OFIA criteria.  
- Provides patient comfort, amnesia for nerve block placement, and maintains an excellent safety profile.

### **2. General Anesthesia Maintenance**
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** is recommended for most rTKA cases due to predictable emergence and low PONV burden.  
- **Propofol TIVA (75–150 mcg/kg/min)** is an appropriate alternative when indicated (PONV history, airway considerations, surgeon preference).

### **3. Multimodal Analgesia as the Foundation**
- Regional blocks (ACB/IPACK) provide the strongest analgesic benefit with quadriceps-sparing recovery advantages.  
- Where blocks are contraindicated, OFIA relies on ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and anti-inflammatory strategies.

### **4. Opioid Stewardship**
- Rescue opioid administration is **never withheld** but is deliberately minimized.  
- Flowcharts prioritize ketamine-based rescue before hydromorphone or fentanyl use.  
- Conventional pathway integrates opioids safely with close PACU monitoring.

### **5. Safety and Monitoring**
All flowcharts reinforce:

- Preparedness for **LAST** — lipid emulsion immediately available  
- Monitoring for dexmedetomidine-associated bradycardia or hypotension  
- Respiratory vigilance, especially in OSA and opioid-exposed patients  
- Postoperative readiness for early mobilization and ERAS goals

## Intended Use

These flowcharts are designed for:

- **Anesthesia residents and fellows** seeking structured, evidence-based guidance  
- **CRNAs and attending anesthesiologists** requiring rapid reference in high-acuity workflow  
- **PACU nurses** who rely on standardized rescue algorithms  
- **Quality improvement and ERAS program teams** building reproducible care pathways

Formats are:

- EMR-friendly  
- Print- and binder-ready  
- Suitable for pocket reference cards when scaled to A6/A7 size  

They **support** but do not replace clinical judgment, institutional protocols, or attending supervision.

## Clinical Updates (Version 1.3)

This version incorporates:

- Reinforced midazolam usage across all pathways  
- Updated sevoflurane and TIVA maintenance dosing ranges  
- Expanded special population considerations (OSA, frailty, chronic opioid use)  
- Clarified rescue sequences for PACU pain management  
- Reinforcement of safety monitoring standards across all intraoperative algorithms

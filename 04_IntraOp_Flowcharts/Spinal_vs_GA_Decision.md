# Spinal vs General Anesthesia  
Decision Algorithm – Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides a structured, text-based decision pathway for choosing spinal vs general anesthesia (GA) in rTKA. It is designed to complement the OFIA and conventional pathways described in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/`.

---

## 1. Initial Screening

### 1.1 Patient Factors

- Review:
  - Age, frailty, functional status  
  - Cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities  
  - Prior anesthesia history (including neuraxial complications)  
  - Cognitive status and risk of postoperative delirium  
  - Anticoagulation and coagulation status (per ASRA 2024–2025)  
  - OSA severity (STOP-Bang score)
  - BMI and positioning challenges

If **hemodynamically unstable** or profoundly frail → favor **carefully titrated neuraxial** or hybrid approach after attending-level discussion.

---

## 2. Anticoagulation and Coagulation Status

1. **Is the patient anticoagulated or coagulopathic?**

   - Check:
     - DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran)  
     - Warfarin (INR)  
     - LMWH (prophylactic vs therapeutic)  
     - Platelet count and known coagulopathies  
     - Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor)

2. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA neuraxial "unsafe" window:**

   - Spinal anesthesia **contraindicated**.  
   - Proceed with **general anesthesia** and consider OFIA with or without regional blocks as appropriate (see adjuncts/ASRA deep block timing).

3. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA "safe" window:**

   - Spinal remains an option; proceed to airway/anatomy assessment.

---

## 3. Airway and Anatomy Considerations

1. **Airway Assessment**

   - Difficult airway predictors (e.g., Mallampati III–IV, limited mouth opening, reduced neck mobility, prior difficult intubation, short thyromental distance).

   - If **anticipated very difficult airway**:
     - Some clinicians prefer securing the airway with GA (awake fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy).  
     - Others may favor spinal to avoid airway instrumentation in selected high-risk patients.  
     - Decision requires attending-level discussion; document rationale clearly.

2. **Spinal/Neuraxial Anatomy**

   - Severe scoliosis, prior lumbar fusion, or hardware  
   - History of failed neuraxial attempts or neuraxial infection
   - Significant spinal stenosis or prior back surgery
   - Skin infection at proposed puncture site

   If **technical difficulty anticipated** or prior neuraxial failure:
   - Consider **general anesthesia** as primary plan.
   - Ultrasound guidance may improve success rate if spinal is preferred.

## 4. Patient Preference and Shared Decision-Making

Discuss, in plain language:

### Spinal Anesthesia:
- **Benefits:**
  - Numbness from waist down  
  - Often less immediate grogginess  
  - Lower PONV risk
  - Excellent postoperative analgesia if combined with blocks
  - May be better for patients with respiratory disease
  
- **Considerations:**
  - May require light sedation (midazolam 1–2 mg standard)
  - Potential for urinary retention, transient hypotension  
  - Small risk of post-dural puncture headache
  - Cannot be "topped up" if duration inadequate

### General Anesthesia:
- **Benefits:**
  - Fully asleep with airway device  
  - Controllable duration
  - No risk of neuraxial complications
  
- **Considerations:**
  - More postoperative grogginess initially
  - Possible sore throat from intubation
  - Slightly higher PONV risk (mitigated with OFIA and multimodal prophylaxis)
  - May require more opioids if blocks not performed

**If patient strongly prefers one modality** and there are no contraindications, align plan with patient preference and document the discussion, including risks/benefits discussed.

---

## 5. Surgical and Workflow Considerations

1. **Robotics Workflow**

   - Most rTKA cases can be performed safely under spinal anesthesia with sedation or under GA.  
   - Confirm with surgeon:
     - Anticipated duration (typical 90–120 min)
     - Positioning requirements  
     - Need for extreme flexion or maneuvers that may be uncomfortable under spinal with light sedation
     - Surgeon comfort level with neuraxial technique

2. **Institutional Throughput**

   - Block room availability  
   - PACU staffing and spinal recovery capacity  
   - Anesthesia team experience with neuraxial techniques
   - Operating room turnover time considerations

---

## 6. Practical Decision Pathway (Text-Based Flow)

1. **Step 1 – Anticoagulation / Coagulopathy**

   - Unsafe neuraxial window or INR > institutional cutoff?  
     - **Yes → General anesthesia.**  
     - **No → Step 2.**

2. **Step 2 – Neuraxial Anatomy**

   - Severe spinal deformity, prior fusion/hardware, or documented difficult/failed neuraxial?  
     - **Yes → General anesthesia (with or without OFIA).**  
     - **No → Step 3.**

3. **Step 3 – Patient Preference**

   - After counseling on risks/benefits, does the patient clearly prefer spinal or clearly prefer GA?  
     - **Prefers spinal → Spinal anesthesia + midazolam 1–2 mg ± light sedation.**  
     - **Prefers GA → General anesthesia (OFIA preferred, conventional if indicated).**  
     - **No strong preference → Step 4.**

4. **Step 4 – Clinical Optimization**

   - High risk of delirium/PONV/respiratory depression (frail, high OSA risk, prior severe PONV, elderly)?  
     - **Yes → Prefer spinal + OFIA (with ACB/IPACK) if safe.**  
     - **No → Either spinal or GA acceptable; choose based on clinician/surgeon preference and workflow.**

Document the final decision in the preoperative note, including:

- Factors considered (anticoagulation, airway, anatomy, preference, comorbidities).  
- Risks and benefits discussed with patient.
- Rationale for spinal vs GA.  
- Planned rescue strategy (e.g., conversion from spinal to GA if needed; airway equipment immediately available).
- Backup plan if spinal is unsuccessful (proceed to GA).

## 7. Anesthetic Technique Details

### 7.1 Spinal Anesthesia
- **Local anesthetic:** Bupivacaine 0.5% hyperbaric, 12–15 mg (adjust for patient height)
- **Adjuncts:** Morphine 100–200 mcg intrathecal (consider if not doing blocks)
- **Sedation:** Midazolam 1–2 mg IV + propofol infusion 25–75 mcg/kg/min PRN
- **Level assessment:** Confirm T10 sensory level before surgical start
- **Monitoring:** Continuous BP monitoring; treat hypotension proactively (phenylephrine, ephedrine)

### 7.2 General Anesthesia
- **Induction:**
  - Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (anxiolysis/amnesia)
  - Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg
  - Ketamine 0.3–0.5 mg/kg (OFIA pathways)
  - Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg

- **Maintenance:**
  - Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC (preferred) or propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min
  - Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr (OFIA pathways)
  - Ketamine 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr (OFIA pathways)

- **Emergence:**
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV
  - Sugammadex 2 mg/kg PRN

## 8. Linkage to Primary Protocols

- Spinal or GA can be combined with:
  - **Protocol 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
  - **Protocol 2:** OFIA Block-Free  
  - **Protocol 3:** Conventional Opioid-Based  

Select the **pathway** first, then layer the **spinal vs GA** decision on top, as appropriate.

**Key principle:** Midazolam (1–2 mg IV) is standard anxiolysis for both spinal and GA approaches and does not compromise OFIA principles.

For detailed dosing and adjuncts, see:

- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md`

## 9. Clinical Pearls

- **Spinal advantages:** Superior postoperative analgesia, less respiratory depression, lower delirium risk in elderly
- **GA advantages:** Controllable duration, airway secured, no neuraxial complications
- **Combination approach:** Spinal with light GA sedation provides benefits of both in selected patients
- **Midazolam use:** Standard 1–2 mg IV for anxiolysis regardless of technique chosen
- **Block integration:** ACB/IPACK can be performed with either spinal or GA
- **Communication:** Clear handoff to PACU regarding technique used and expected recovery trajectory

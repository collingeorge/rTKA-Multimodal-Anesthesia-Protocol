# Spinal vs General Anesthesia
Decision Algorithm – Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides a structured, text-based decision pathway for selecting **spinal anesthesia** versus **general anesthesia (GA)** for rTKA. It is designed to complement the OFIA and conventional pathways in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/`.

Both spinal and GA can be combined with:
- **Protocol 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK
- **Protocol 2:** OFIA Block-Free
- **Protocol 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

> Scope note: This repository is primarily **GA/TIVA + peripheral regional + multimodal** focused. Neuraxial adjunct opioids are **not standardized** here; if used, follow institutional policy and monitoring standards.

## 1. Initial Screening

### 1.1 Patient Factors
Review:
- Age, frailty, functional status (METs)
- Cardiovascular disease (CAD, CHF, arrhythmias, valvular pathology)
- Pulmonary disease (COPD, asthma, restrictive pathology)
- Prior anesthesia history (including neuraxial complications)
- Cognitive status and delirium risk
- OSA severity (STOP-Bang) and home CPAP use
- BMI and positioning challenges
- Anticoagulation / coagulation status (neuraxial safety per society guidance)

Clinical notes:
- Significant respiratory disease, high OSA risk, or delirium vulnerability can favor **spinal + multimodal/OFIA philosophy** when neuraxial is safe.
- Baseline hemodynamic fragility or poor tolerance of sympathectomy may favor **carefully titrated GA/TIVA** after attending-level discussion.

## 2. Anticoagulation and Coagulation Status (Neuraxial Safety Gate)

### 2.1 Core principle
For **neuraxial** anesthesia (spinal) and **high bleeding-risk blocks**, follow contemporary society guidance and institutional policy. Deep peripheral blocks are commonly managed using *the same risk tier* as neuraxial in many workflows.

### 2.2 Practical timing framework (dose- and renal-aware)
Use this as a **screening** reference; defer to local policy when it differs:

- **Direct Xa inhibitors (apixaban/rivaroxaban/edoxaban):**
  - *Low-dose regimens:* minimum interruption often **24–36 h** (agent dependent; apixaban commonly **36 h**). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  - *High-dose/therapeutic regimens:* minimum interruption commonly **72 h**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  - **Renal impairment** may require longer intervals (especially for some agents/regimens). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Dabigatran (DTI):**
  - *Low-dose:* often **48 h** minimum. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
  - *High-dose:* commonly **72 h** minimum, with longer holds in reduced CrCl. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- **LMWH:**
  - Prophylactic dosing: typically **≥12 h** (longer if CrCl <30). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
  - Therapeutic dosing: typically **≥24 h** (longer if CrCl <30). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

- **Warfarin (VKA):**
  - Proceed only when INR is at/near institutional neuraxial threshold (commonly ≤1.4–1.5). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

If anticoagulation is **within an unsafe neuraxial window**:
- **Spinal is contraindicated** → proceed with **GA (prefer OFIA pathways when appropriate)**.

If anticoagulation is **within a safe window**:
- Spinal remains an option → proceed to airway/anatomy feasibility and patient preference.

## 3. Airway and Neuraxial Anatomy Considerations

### 3.1 Airway Assessment (GA feasibility and contingency planning)
Consider difficult airway predictors:
- Mallampati III–IV, limited mouth opening, reduced neck mobility
- Short thyromental distance
- Prior documented difficult intubation
- Significant craniofacial abnormalities

If anticipated very difficult airway:
- GA may still be preferred with an advanced airway plan.
- If spinal is chosen to reduce airway manipulation, **conversion to GA must be immediately feasible** and explicitly planned/documented.

### 3.2 Neuraxial Anatomy (spinal feasibility)
Assess:
- Severe scoliosis/kyphosis
- Prior lumbar fusion/hardware
- Significant spinal stenosis or prior major back surgery
- History of failed neuraxial attempts
- Local infection at puncture site

If substantial technical difficulty is expected:
- Prefer **GA** (OFIA or conventional as indicated).
- If spinal is still preferred, document a hard stop (e.g., “max 2 attempts then convert to GA”) and consider neuraxial ultrasound.

## 4. Patient Preference and Shared Decision-Making

If no contraindications:
- Align with patient preference after counseling.
- Document risks/benefits and rationale.

**Spinal anesthesia – key points**
- Often less immediate grogginess; may reduce PONV
- Requires positioning for placement
- Sympathectomy-related hypotension risk; urinary retention; rare PDPH
- Duration finite; plan for conversion if inadequate or prolonged surgery

**GA – key points**
- Fully asleep; duration easily controlled
- Avoids neuraxial-specific complications
- PONV and sore throat risks (mitigated with multimodal strategies and OFIA/TIVA)

---

## 5. Practical Decision Pathway (Text-Based)

**Step 1 – Anticoagulation / Coagulopathy**
- Unsafe neuraxial window, significant coagulopathy, or INR above threshold?
  - **Yes → GA**
  - **No → Step 2**

**Step 2 – Neuraxial anatomy feasibility**
- High likelihood of difficult/failed spinal due to anatomy/history?
  - **Yes → GA**
  - **No → Step 3**

**Step 3 – Patient preference**
- Clear preference for spinal or GA?
  - **Spinal → spinal + light sedation as needed**
  - **GA → GA (OFIA preferred when appropriate)**
  - **No strong preference → Step 4**

**Step 4 – Clinical optimization**
- High risk of delirium/PONV/respiratory depression (frail, high OSA risk, severe pulmonary disease, prior severe PONV)?
  - **Yes → prefer spinal when safe**
  - **No → spinal or GA acceptable; choose based on clinician/surgeon workflow and resources**

Documentation expectations:
- Anticoagulation status/timing logic
- Airway assessment and contingency plan
- Neuraxial feasibility assessment
- Patient preference and shared decision-making
- Final technique + rationale, including backup plan

## 6. Technique Snapshots (Repository-Consistent)

### 6.1 Spinal anesthesia (typical rTKA ranges)
- **Local anesthetic:** hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% commonly ~**10–15 mg** (individualize; lower end for elderly/frail or shorter cases). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **Sedation (as needed):**
  - Midazolam 0.5–2 mg IV (titrate; elderly/OSA lower end)
  - Propofol infusion (light sedation) as clinically indicated
- **Hemodynamics:**
  - Treat hypotension promptly (phenylephrine vs ephedrine guided by HR and physiology)
  - Maintain individualized MAP target (often ≥65 mmHg unless otherwise specified)

> Neuraxial opioids (e.g., intrathecal morphine) are not standardized in this repository. If used, follow institutional dosing/monitoring.

### 6.2 General anesthesia (OFIA-forward snapshot)
**Induction**
- Midazolam (titrated)
- Propofol
- Ketamine (per OFIA protocol selection)
- Rocuronium as indicated

**Maintenance**
- **Propofol TIVA** (repository-default where feasible)
  - OR sevoflurane as an acceptable alternative based on attending preference/patient factors
- Dexmedetomidine and ketamine infusions per pathway (when OFIA selected)

**Emergence**
- Multimodal PONV prophylaxis
- NMBA reversal per TOF and institutional policy
- Extubate when awake or easily arousable with adequate ventilation and stable hemodynamics

# Spinal vs General Anesthesia  
Decision Algorithm – Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides a structured, text-based decision pathway for choosing spinal versus general anesthesia (GA) in rTKA. It is designed to complement the OFIA and conventional pathways described in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/`.

Both spinal and GA can be safely combined with:

- **Protocol 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
- **Protocol 2:** OFIA Block-Free  
- **Protocol 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

## 1. Initial Screening

### 1.1 Patient Factors

Review:

- Age, frailty, functional status (METs)
- Cardiovascular disease (CAD, CHF, arrhythmias)
- Pulmonary disease (COPD, asthma, restrictive pathology)
- Prior anesthesia history (including neuraxial complications)
- Cognitive status and risk of postoperative delirium
- OSA severity (STOP-Bang score) and home CPAP use
- Anticoagulation and coagulation status (per **ASRA 2024–2025**)
- BMI and positioning challenges

**Clinical note:**

- Profound frailty, high delirium risk, or significant respiratory disease often favor **spinal anesthesia + OFIA** (when neuraxial is safe).  
- **Hemodynamic instability** at baseline or poor tolerance of sympathectomy may favor **carefully titrated GA** or a hybrid strategy after attending-level discussion.

---

## 2. Anticoagulation and Coagulation Status

1. **Is the patient anticoagulated or coagulopathic?**

   Check for:

   - DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran)  
   - Warfarin (INR)  
   - LMWH (prophylactic vs therapeutic)  
   - Platelet count and known coagulopathies  
   - Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor)

2. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA neuraxial “unsafe” window:**

   - Spinal anesthesia **contraindicated**.  
   - Proceed with **general anesthesia**, selecting:
     - **OFIA + ACB/IPACK** if deep peripheral blocks are also ASRA-safe, or  
     - **Block-free OFIA** or **conventional opioid-based** pathway as indicated.

3. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA “safe” window:**

   - Spinal remains an option.  
   - Proceed to airway and neuraxial anatomy assessment.

## 3. Airway and Neuraxial Anatomy Considerations

### 3.1 Airway Assessment

Difficult airway predictors:

- Mallampati III–IV
- Limited mouth opening
- Reduced neck mobility
- Short thyromental distance
- Prior documented difficult intubation
- Significant craniofacial abnormalities

**If anticipated very difficult airway:**

- Some clinicians favor **awake fiberoptic or advanced airway techniques under GA**.  
- In selected patients, spinal with minimal sedation may avoid airway instrumentation, but **conversion to GA must be immediately feasible**.  
- Decision requires attending-level discussion and **explicit documentation of rationale and backup plan**.

### 3.2 Neuraxial Anatomy

Assess for:

- Severe scoliosis or kyphosis  
- Prior lumbar fusion or hardware  
- Significant spinal stenosis or prior major back surgery  
- History of failed neuraxial attempts  
- Local infection at proposed puncture site

If **substantial technical difficulty or prior neuraxial failure is expected:**

- Consider **GA as the primary plan**.  
- Neuraxial ultrasound may improve success rates if spinal is still strongly preferred.  
- Document anticipated difficulty and contingency plan (e.g., “max 2 attempts, then GA”).

## 4. Patient Preference and Shared Decision-Making

Explain options in plain language:

### Spinal Anesthesia

**Benefits:**

- Numbs the lower body for surgery  
- Often less immediate grogginess after surgery  
- Lower PONV risk compared to GA without OFIA  
- Excellent postoperative analgesia when combined with ACB/IPACK  
- Often preferable in significant respiratory disease or high OSA risk

**Considerations:**

- Requires sitting or lateral positioning for placement  
- May need light sedation (midazolam 1–2 mg IV standard)  
- Potential for hypotension, urinary retention, and rare post-dural puncture headache  
- Block duration finite; limited ability to “extend” if surgery goes long

### General Anesthesia

**Benefits:**

- Fully asleep with airway secured (LMA or ETT)  
- Duration easily controlled  
- Avoids neuraxial-related complications  
- Familiar to most patients

**Considerations:**

- More immediate postoperative grogginess  
- Slightly higher PONV risk (mitigated by OFIA and multimodal prophylaxis)  
- Possible sore throat from airway device  
- May require more opioids if blocks not used

**If the patient clearly prefers one modality** and there are no contraindications:

- Align with patient preference.  
- Document risks, benefits, and rationale in the preoperative note.

## 5. Surgical and Workflow Considerations

1. **Robotics Workflow**

   - Most rTKA cases are suitable for **spinal + light sedation** or **GA**.  
   - Confirm with surgeon:
     - Anticipated duration (typically ~90–120 minutes)  
     - Positioning requirements and extremes of flexion  
     - Acceptability of spinal with sedation vs preference for GA

2. **Institutional Throughput and Resources**

   - Block room and neuraxial workflow availability  
   - PACU capacity to monitor spinal patients  
   - Anesthesia team experience and comfort with neuraxial techniques  
   - Turnover time implications

---

## 6. Practical Decision Pathway (Text-Based Flow)

**Step 1 – Anticoagulation / Coagulopathy**

- Anticoagulation within ASRA neuraxial “unsafe” window or INR above institutional cutoff?  
  - **Yes → General anesthesia.**  
  - **No → Step 2.**

**Step 2 – Neuraxial Anatomy**

- Severe spinal deformity, prior extensive lumbar fusion/hardware, or documented difficult/failed neuraxial?  
  - **Yes → General anesthesia (OFIA or conventional).**  
  - **No → Step 3.**

**Step 3 – Patient Preference**

- After counseling, does the patient clearly prefer **spinal** or clearly prefer **GA**?  
  - **Prefers spinal → Spinal anesthesia + midazolam 1–2 mg IV ± light sedation.**  
  - **Prefers GA → GA (OFIA preferred when appropriate; conventional opioid-based if indicated).**  
  - **No strong preference → Step 4.**

**Step 4 – Clinical Optimization**

- High risk of delirium, PONV, or respiratory depression (elderly, frail, high OSA risk, prior severe PONV, major pulmonary disease)?  
  - **Yes → Prefer spinal + OFIA (with ACB/IPACK) if neuraxial is ASRA-safe.**  
  - **No → Either spinal or GA acceptable; choose based on clinician/surgeon preference, workflow, and resource availability.**

**Documentation expectations:**

- Factors considered: anticoagulation, airway, anatomy, comorbidities, OSA, delirium risk, preference.  
- Risks/benefits discussed and patient’s stated preference.  
- Final choice (spinal vs GA) and rationale.  
- Backup plan (e.g., conversion from spinal to GA if inadequate; airway readiness if spinal fails).

## 7. Technique Snapshots

### 7.1 Spinal Anesthesia (Typical rTKA Approach)

- **Local anesthetic:**  
  - Bupivacaine 0.5% hyperbaric, ~10–15 mg (individualize; lower end for elderly/frail or shorter cases).  
- **Optional intrathecal opioid:**  
  - Morphine 100–200 mcg (consider only if not using robust peripheral blocks; caution in OSA/obesity).  
- **Sedation:**  
  - Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (standard anxiolysis).  
  - Propofol infusion 25–75 mcg/kg/min as needed for comfort.  
- **Monitoring and management:**  
  - Confirm sensory level to at least T10 before incision.  
  - Treat hypotension promptly (phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV or ephedrine 5–10 mg IV depending on HR).  
  - Maintain MAP ≥65 mmHg (individualize for CAD/cerebrovascular disease).

### 7.2 General Anesthesia (Typical rTKA Approach)

**Induction:**

- Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (anxiolysis/amnesia)  
- Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg  
- Ketamine 0.3–0.5 mg/kg (for OFIA protocols)  
- Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg

**Maintenance:**

- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** (common first-line)  
  - OR **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (high PONV risk or MH susceptibility).  
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr** (OFIA)  
- **Ketamine 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr** (OFIA)

**Emergence:**

- Ondansetron 4 mg IV  
- Neuromuscular reversal with sugammadex 2 mg/kg (TOF ≥2) or 4 mg/kg (deeper block)  
- Extubation when fully awake or easily arousable, with adequate ventilation and stable hemodynamics

## 8. Linkage to Primary Protocols

Once spinal vs GA is chosen, integrate with:

- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md`  
- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md`  
- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md`  
- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_4_Adjuncts_Contraindications.md`  
- `../03_Anesthesia_Protocols/Protocol_Medication_Dosing_and_Timing.md`

**Key principle:**  
Midazolam **1–2 mg IV** is standard anxiolysis across all techniques and is compatible with OFIA.

---

## 9. Clinical Pearls

- **Spinal + OFIA + ACB/IPACK** often provides the best balance of early analgesia, low PONV, and delirium reduction in appropriately selected patients.  
- **GA** is appropriate and often preferred when neuraxial is contraindicated, technically high-risk, or strongly declined by the patient.  
- A **hybrid approach** (spinal with light GA sedation) can be used for longer or more complex cases, with a clear backup airway plan.  
- Early, explicit communication with the surgical and PACU teams about the selected technique improves workflow and patient expectations.  
- Always maintain a **clear, documented backup plan** for spinal failure, high spinal, or airway difficulty.

# Spinal vs General Anesthesia  
Decision Algorithm – Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This document provides a structured, text-based decision pathway for choosing spinal vs general anesthesia (GA) in rTKA. It is designed to complement the OFIA and conventional pathways described in `03_Anesthesia_Protocols/`.

---

## 1. Initial Screening

### 1.1 Patient Factors

- Review:
  - Age, frailty, functional status  
  - Cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities  
  - Prior anesthesia history (including neuraxial complications)  
  - Cognitive status and risk of postoperative delirium  
  - Anticoagulation and coagulation status (per ASRA 2024–2025)  

If **hemodynamically unstable** or profoundly frail → favor **carefully titrated neuraxial** or hybrid approach after attending-level discussion.

---

## 2. Anticoagulation and Coagulation Status

1. **Is the patient anticoagulated or coagulopathic?**

   - Check:
     - DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran)  
     - Warfarin (INR)  
     - LMWH (prophylactic vs therapeutic)  
     - Platelet count and known coagulopathies  

2. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA neuraxial “unsafe” window:**

   - Spinal anesthesia **contraindicated**.  
   - Proceed with **general anesthesia** and consider OFIA with or without regional blocks as appropriate (see adjuncts/ASRA deep block timing).

3. **If anticoagulation is within ASRA “safe” window:**

   - Spinal remains an option; proceed to airway/anatomy assessment.

---

## 3. Airway and Anatomy Considerations

1. **Airway Assessment**

   - Difficult airway predictors (e.g., Mallampati III–IV, limited mouth opening, reduced neck mobility, prior difficult intubation).

   - If **anticipated very difficult airway**:
     - Some clinicians prefer securing the airway with GA (awake or controlled).  
     - Others may favor spinal to avoid airway instrumentation in selected high-risk patients.  
     - Decision requires attending-level discussion; document rationale.

2. **Spinal/Neuraxial Anatomy**

   - Severe scoliosis, prior lumbar fusion, or hardware  
   - History of failed neuraxial attempts or neuraxial infection

   If **technical difficulty anticipated** or prior neuraxial failure:
   - Consider **general anesthesia** as primary plan.

---

## 4. Patient Preference and Shared Decision-Making

Discuss, in plain language:

- Spinal anesthesia:
  - Numbness from waist down  
  - Often less immediate grogginess  
  - May require light sedation  
  - Potential for urinary retention, transient hypotension  

- General anesthesia:
  - Fully asleep with airway device  
  - More postoperative grogginess and possible sore throat  
  - Slightly higher PONV risk depending on agents used  

**If patient strongly prefers one modality** and there are no contraindications, align plan with patient preference and document the discussion.

---

## 5. Surgical and Workflow Considerations

1. **Robotics Workflow**

   - Most rTKA cases can be performed safely under spinal anesthesia with sedation or under GA.  
   - Confirm with surgeon:
     - Anticipated duration  
     - Positioning requirements  
     - Need for extreme flexion or maneuvers that may be uncomfortable under spinal with light sedation.

2. **Institutional Throughput**

   - Block room availability  
   - PACU staffing and spinal recovery capacity  

---

## 6. Practical Decision Pathway (Text-Based Flow)

1. **Step 1 – Anticoagulation / Coagulopathy**

   - Unsafe neuraxial window or INR > institutional cutoff?  
     - **Yes → General anesthesia.**  
     - **No → Step 2.**

2. **Step 2 – Neuraxial Anatomy**

   - Severe spinal deformity, prior fusion/hardware, or documented difficult/failed neuraxial?  
     - **Yes → General anesthesia (with or without OFIA).**  
     - **No → Step 3.**

3. **Step 3 – Patient Preference**

   - After counseling, does the patient clearly prefer spinal or clearly prefer GA?  
     - **Prefers spinal → Spinal anesthesia ± light sedation.**  
     - **Prefers GA → General anesthesia (OFIA or conventional).**  
     - **No strong preference → Step 4.**

4. **Step 4 – Clinical Optimization**

   - High risk of delirium/PONV/respiratory depression (frail, high OSA risk, prior severe PONV)?  
     - **Yes → Prefer spinal + OFIA (with ACB/IPACK) if safe.**  
     - **No → Either spinal or GA acceptable; choose based on clinician/surgeon preference and workflow.**

Document the final decision in the preoperative note, including:

- Factors considered (anticoagulation, airway, anatomy, preference).  
- Rationale for spinal vs GA.  
- Planned rescue strategy (e.g., conversion from spinal to GA if needed).

## 7. Linkage to Primary Protocols

- Spinal or GA can be combined with:
  - **Protocol 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
  - **Protocol 2:** OFIA Block-Free  
  - **Protocol 3:** Conventional Opioid-Based  

Select the **pathway** first, then layer the **spinal vs GA** decision on top, as appropriate.

# PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This algorithm standardizes PACU pain assessment and rescue strategies across the three primary anesthesia pathways. It emphasizes multimodal analgesia, opioid stewardship, and safety. It is designed to remain cohesive with the rTKA anesthesia protocols, contraindication module, and PACU handoff templates.

## 1. Confirm Anesthesia Pathway and Key Intraop Details

At PACU arrival, confirm from OR handoff:

- **Pathway 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK
- **Pathway 2:** OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration)
- **Pathway 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive

Also confirm:
- ACB/IPACK performed? Coverage/quality? Any concerns for partial block or regression?
- Intraoperative agents and stop times: **ketamine**, **dexmedetomidine**, **magnesium**, **lidocaine** (if used)
- Last opioid dose and estimated total intraoperative opioid exposure (if any)
- Major perioperative risks: **OSA**, frailty, delirium risk, COPD/OHS, hemodynamic instability

---

## 2. Standard Assessment (Arrival, then q15–30 min or per institutional policy)

Document:
- **Pain:** NRS 0–10 (rest + gentle movement if appropriate)
- **Sedation:** RASS (or institutional scale)
- **PONV:** nausea score / emesis
- **Vitals:** HR, BP/MAP, RR, SpO₂ (baseline target individualized)

**Analgesia goal (practical):**
- Achieve **meaningful pain reduction** with **preserved ventilation and mentation**.
- Avoid “pain-free” escalation if sedation/respiratory risk is increasing.

---

## 3. Baseline Multimodal Analgesia (All Pathways)

Unless contraindicated, confirm scheduled multimodal orders are active and administered:

### Acetaminophen
- **1 g PO/IV q6h**
- Usual max **4 g/day** (use lower max per institutional/hepatic guidance)

### NSAID / COX-2 (choose one strategy; avoid stacking)
- **Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h**, *or*
- **Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily**, *or*
- **Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h** (max **60 mg/day**; short duration only)

**Avoid/Use caution with NSAIDs/ketorolac** in:
- Significant renal impairment (e.g., **CrCl <30 mL/min**), high bleeding risk, active GI ulcer/bleed, uncontrolled HTN, advanced frailty, or surgeon-specific restrictions.

If baseline multimodal dosing has not occurred (or is overdue), correct that before escalating rescue medications.

---

## 4. Pathway-Specific Pain Expectations (Context, Not Guarantees)

- **Pathway 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK):** often lower early pain; if NRS ≥4 consider patchy block, tourniquet discomfort, positioning pain, anxiety, or early regression.
- **Pathway 2 (OFIA block-free):** often higher pain in first 12–24h, especially with movement; systemic multimodal + surgeon infiltration are primary.
- **Pathway 3 (opioid-inclusive):** variable pain; higher sedation/PONV risk; greater need for respiratory monitoring during escalation.

---

## 5. Stepwise Rescue Algorithm (Text-Based)

### Step 1 — “Safety Gate” (All Pathways)
Before rescue dosing, verify:
- Airway/ventilation: RR adequate, patient arousable, no progressive hypoventilation
- Hemodynamics: MAP at/near target (typically ≥65 mmHg unless individualized)
- No “red flags” for surgical complication:
  - Pain out of proportion + tense swelling, severe pain with passive stretch → urgent evaluation
  - New motor deficit, vascular compromise, uncontrolled bleeding → urgent evaluation

If unstable or red flags present → **notify anesthesia and surgeon immediately** before giving additional analgesia.

---

### Step 2 — Non-Opioid Rescue (Preferred First-Line)

#### OFIA Pathways (1 & 2): Ketamine-first when appropriate
If **NRS ≥4** and sedation is acceptable (e.g., RASS –1 to 0) and no contraindication:

- **Ketamine IV bolus:** **0.1 mg/kg** (up to **0.15 mg/kg**) IV **slowly over 2–3 min**
- May repeat **q10–15 min**, **maximum 3 doses**
  - Typical cumulative total: **~0.3 mg/kg** (up to **0.45 mg/kg**)

Monitor for dysphoria, agitation, nausea, and hypertension/tachycardia (generally uncommon at these doses).

**Use caution / consider avoiding ketamine** in:
- Active psychosis or severe uncontrolled agitation
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension or unstable ischemic symptoms
- Situations where altered perception would be particularly unsafe (clinician judgment)

#### Conventional Pathway (3): Consider ketamine as opioid-sparing rescue
If NRS ≥4 and further opioid escalation is undesirable (OSA/frailty/opioid tolerance), consider the same **low-dose ketamine rescue** above if not contraindicated.

---

### Step 3 — Opioid Rescue (When Needed; All Pathways)
If pain remains clinically unacceptable after baseline multimodal measures (and ketamine rescue when appropriate), or ketamine is contraindicated:

- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN**
  - **High-risk (OSA/frail/elderly/opioid-naïve): start 0.1 mg IV** increments
  - Reassess **pain + sedation + RR/SpO₂** before each repeat dose
  - Use the minimal effective cumulative dose

**Oral opioid option (selected cases):**
- If awake, tolerating PO, and pain is moderate/stable with minimal PONV, consider small-dose oral opioid per institutional order set.

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry while receiving IV opioids
- Strongly consider capnography for high-risk patients (OSA/OHS, obesity, escalating opioid dosing, frailty)

---

### Step 4 — Reassessment and Escalation
After each rescue intervention:
- Reassess within **10–15 minutes**:
  - NRS, sedation, RR, SpO₂, hemodynamics, overall comfort

Escalate immediately if:
- NRS remains ≥7 despite appropriate rescue, **or**
- Pain is out of proportion / concerning exam findings, **or**
- New neurovascular deficit or expanding hematoma suspected

Actions:
- Notify anesthesia attending and surgeon
- Consider block failure (Pathway 1), hematoma, evolving compartment syndrome, or other surgical complication
- Document findings and communications clearly

---

## 6. PONV and Safety

### PONV (PACU Rescue)
Baseline prophylaxis often includes intraop ondansetron ± dexamethasone; scopolamine in high-risk patients.

PACU rescue options (institution-dependent):
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV q6h PRN**
- If inadequate response, consider switching class/mechanism:
  - Metoclopramide 10 mg IV (if appropriate)
  - Promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg IV (caution: sedation)

Avoid repeating the same mechanism repeatedly without effect.

### Naloxone (Opioid-Related Respiratory Depression)
If clinically significant respiratory depression occurs:
- Ensure airway support and oxygenation first
- **Naloxone titration:** **0.04–0.1 mg IV** q1–2 min to restore ventilation (avoid abrupt full reversal when possible)

Naloxone must be immediately available when IV opioids are administered.

### LAST Preparedness (Relevant to Pathway 1 / Recent Blocks)
Monitor for early neurologic symptoms (perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste), seizures, or arrhythmias. Treat per institutional LAST protocol; ensure lipid availability per block safety standards.

---

## 7. Documentation Expectations (Minimum Standard)
Document:
- Pathway used (1/2/3)
- Blocks performed and perceived quality (if applicable)
- Pain/sedation scores at defined intervals
- Rescue meds: drug, dose, time, response, adverse effects
- Monitoring escalation (capnography, extended observation) when indicated
- Communications with anesthesia/surgery for uncontrolled pain or red flags
- Handoff to floor: effective rescue strategy, ongoing regimen, total PACU opioid exposure, patient-specific risks (OSA/frailty/delirium/fall risk)

---

## 8. Special Populations (Dose Guardrails)

### Frail / Elderly
- Prefer conservative rescue dosing:
  - Ketamine **≤0.1 mg/kg** per bolus
  - Hydromorphone **0.1 mg IV increments**
- Allow longer reassessment intervals if borderline sedation

### OSA / OHS / Significant Respiratory Disease
- Prefer ketamine and non-opioid strategies when feasible
- Minimize opioid dosing; consider capnography
- Reinforce home CPAP use when clinically appropriate

### Opioid-Tolerant
- Expect higher analgesic requirements; ketamine may be particularly helpful
- Coordinate with acute pain service if available
- Set realistic expectations: “improved, not zero” pain

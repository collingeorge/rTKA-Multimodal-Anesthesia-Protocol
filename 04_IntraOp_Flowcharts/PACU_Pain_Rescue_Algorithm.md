# PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This algorithm standardizes PACU pain assessment and rescue strategies across the three primary anesthesia pathways. It emphasizes multimodal analgesia, opioid stewardship, and safety, and is designed to be cohesive with the rTKA anesthesia protocols and PACU handoff templates.

## 1. Identify Anesthesia Pathway

At PACU arrival, confirm pathway from OR handoff:

- **Pathway 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
- **Pathway 2:** OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration)  
- **Pathway 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive  

Also confirm:

- Whether **ACB/IPACK** were performed, and whether blocks appear to be functioning  
- Intraoperative use and stop times for **ketamine**, **dexmedetomidine**, and **magnesium**  
- **Midazolam** administration (standard anxiolytic in all pathways)  
- Last **opioid dose** and total intraoperative opioid (if any)

---

## 2. Standard Pain Assessment

At arrival and at regular intervals (e.g., q15–30 min):

- Numeric Rating Scale (**NRS 0–10**) at rest and with gentle knee movement  
- Sedation score (e.g., **RASS** or institution-specific scale)  
- Nausea/PONV assessment  
- Vital signs:
  - HR, BP (MAP), RR, SpO₂

Target:

- NRS ≤3 at rest and ≤4 with gentle movement, when clinically achievable  
- RASS approximately 0 to –1 (calm, awake or lightly drowsy but easily arousable)

---

## 3. Baseline Multimodal Analgesia (All Pathways)

Unless contraindicated, ensure **scheduled multimodal analgesia** is ordered and administered:

- **Acetaminophen**  
  - 1 g PO/IV q6h (max 4 g/day; lower max per institutional or hepatic guidance)

- **NSAID / COX-2 inhibitor** (choose **one strategy**, not all simultaneously):  
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h, **or**  
  - Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily, **or**  
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day; limit to 48–72 hours; avoid in significant renal impairment or high bleeding risk)

Confirm these are active and given on schedule before escalating rescue measures.

---

## 4. Pathway-Specific Pain Expectations

- **Pathway 1 – OFIA + ACB/IPACK:**  
  - Expected PACU NRS: **0–3/10**  
  - If NRS ≥4, consider:
    - Incomplete or patchy block  
    - Tourniquet-related pain (often improves over time)  
    - Positioning pain or anxiety  
    - Early block regression (less common in PACU timeframe)

- **Pathway 2 – OFIA, Block-Free:**  
  - Expected PACU NRS: **3–6/10** during the first 12–24 hours  
  - Pain often more pronounced with movement due to absence of ACB/IPACK  
  - Analgesia relies on multimodal systemic therapy and surgeon periarticular infiltration

- **Pathway 3 – Conventional Opioid-Inclusive:**  
  - Expected NRS: **2–6/10**, variability higher  
  - Sedation and PONV risk increased due to intraoperative opioids  
  - Requires more vigilant respiratory and sedation monitoring

---

## 5. Stepwise Rescue Algorithm (Text-Based Flow)

### Step 1 – Confirm Basics (All Pathways)

Before administering rescue medications:

- Verify:
  - Scheduled **acetaminophen** and **NSAID/COX-2** have been given or are due  
  - Vital signs:
    - MAP ≥65 mmHg (or individualized target for CAD/cerebrovascular disease)  
    - RR ≥10/min  
    - SpO₂ ≥92% (or baseline for chronic lung disease)  
  - No emergent cause of pain:
    - Disproportionate pain, tense swelling, severe pain with passive stretch → consider compartment syndrome  
    - New neurologic deficit → urgent evaluation  
    - Unusual bleeding or severe hemodynamic instability → consider surgical complication
  - Adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade (if applicable)

If unstable or concerning exam findings → **notify anesthesia and surgeon immediately** before giving additional analgesia.

---

### Step 2 – Non-Opioid Rescue (Preferred First-Line)

#### OFIA Pathways (1 and 2)

If NRS ≥4 and sedation is appropriate (e.g., RASS –1 to 0):

- **Ketamine IV bolus:**
  - 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV over 2–3 minutes  
  - May repeat q10–15 minutes, **maximum 3 doses** (total ~0.3–0.45 mg/kg)  
  - Monitor for dysphoria, perceptual changes, or agitation (rare at these doses)

- **Non-pharmacologic measures:**
  - Ice to surgical site  
  - Elevation and optimal positioning of the limb  
  - Reassurance and anxiety management  
  - Environmental control (noise, light, temperature)

#### Conventional Pathway (3)

If NRS ≥4:

- Confirm scheduled non-opioid multimodal agents are active  
- Consider **the same low-dose ketamine rescue** as above, particularly in opioid-tolerant patients or when further opioid escalation is undesirable  
- If ketamine is contraindicated or not available, proceed to Step 3 (opioid rescue) with heightened caution

---

### Step 3 – Opioid Rescue (When Needed)

#### OFIA Pathways (1 and 2)

If NRS remains ≥4–5 after:

- Scheduled multimodal analgesia **and**  
- Up to 3 ketamine rescue doses (if not contraindicated):

→ Initiate **low-dose opioid rescue**:

- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN** for NRS ≥4  
  - In frail, elderly, or OSA patients, consider starting at **0.1 mg IV**  
  - Reassess pain, sedation, and respiratory status before each repeat dose  
  - Use the **minimal effective total dose**

#### Conventional Pathway (3)

- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN** for NRS ≥4  
  - Consider 0.1 mg IV increments in high-risk patients (elderly, OSA, frail)  
- **Oral opioid** (e.g., oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO) may be appropriate if:
  - Patient is awake, tolerating oral fluids  
  - Pain is moderate and stable  
  - PONV is absent or well-controlled

**In all pathways:**

- Continuous monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression
- Consider capnography for high-risk patients (OSA, obesity, high opioid dose)
- Maintain naloxone immediately available (see Safety section)

---

### Step 4 – Reassessment and Escalation

After every rescue intervention (ketamine or opioid):

- Reassess within **10–15 minutes**:
  - NRS pain score  
  - Sedation level  
  - RR and SpO₂  
  - Overall comfort and mental status

If:

- NRS remains ≥7, or  
- Pain is out of proportion to exam, or  
- New neurologic or vascular findings are present:

→ **Escalate immediately:**

- Notify anesthesia attending and surgeon  
- Consider:
  - Block failure or non-functional regional technique (Pathway 1)  
  - Compartment syndrome or hematoma  
  - Other surgical complication requiring urgent evaluation

Document all findings and actions taken.

## 6. PONV and Safety Considerations

### PONV Management

- **Baseline prophylaxis** usually includes:
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV intra-op ± dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV  
  - Scopolamine patch in high-risk patients

- **Rescue therapy in PACU:**
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV q6h PRN  
  - Consider:
    - Promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg IV (caution: sedation)  
    - Metoclopramide 10 mg IV (if no contraindications)  
  - Avoid duplicating same-class antiemetics without effect; rotate mechanisms when possible

### Safety Monitoring

- Continuous **SpO₂** monitoring while receiving IV opioids or ketamine  
- **Capnography** strongly considered in:
  - OSA, morbid obesity  
  - Significant opioid dosing  
  - Elderly or frail patients  
- **Naloxone** immediately available:
  - Have 0.4 mg vials at bedside  
  - For respiratory depression (RR <8–10, SpO₂ <90% despite O₂, unresponsiveness):
    - Titrate in **0.04–0.1 mg IV increments** every 1–2 minutes until adequate ventilation is restored  
- **LAST preparedness:**
  - 20% lipid emulsion available  
  - Monitor for:
    - Perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste  
    - Agitation, seizures, or arrhythmias  
  - Treat per institutional LAST protocol if suspected

---

## 7. Documentation Expectations

PACU record should clearly document:

- Anesthesia pathway used (1, 2, or 3)  
- Regional blocks performed, quality, and coverage (if applicable)  
- Midazolam and other sedatives given and observed effects  
- Pain scores (NRS) and sedation scores at defined intervals  
- All rescue medications:
  - Drug, dose, route, time, and **patient response**  
- Any communication with anesthesia and surgery regarding:
  - Uncontrolled pain  
  - Suspected block failure or surgical complication  
  - Concerns about respiratory status or hemodynamics  
- Handoff summary to ward/floor including:
  - Effective rescue strategies  
  - Ongoing multimodal regimen (with last administration times)  
  - Total opioid exposure in PACU (MME if tracked)  
  - Patient-specific cautions (OSA, delirium risk, frailty, fall risk)

---

## 8. Special Population Considerations

### Elderly / Frail Patients (>70 years or clinically frail)

- Start at lower rescue doses:
  - Ketamine ≤0.1 mg/kg per bolus  
  - Hydromorphone 0.1 mg IV increments  
- Allow more time between doses before repeating  
- Extended observation for delayed respiratory depression or delirium  
- Emphasize non-pharmacologic measures and consistent reorientation

### OSA / Significant Respiratory Disease

- Prefer ketamine and non-opioid strategies whenever feasible  
- Minimize opioid dose and frequency  
- Consider:
  - Continuous pulse oximetry and capnography  
  - Lower threshold for step-down/ICU level monitoring after high opioid use  
- Reinforce use of home CPAP as soon as clinically appropriate

### Opioid-Tolerant Patients

- Ketamine often particularly helpful:
  - May use upper end of rescue range (0.15 mg/kg) if tolerated  
- Expect higher opioid requirements; coordinate with:
  - Chronic pain or acute pain service if available  
- Set realistic expectations with the patient regarding “improved but not zero” pain

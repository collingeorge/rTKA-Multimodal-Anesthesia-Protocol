# PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This algorithm standardizes PACU pain assessment and rescue strategies across the three primary anesthesia pathways. It emphasizes multimodal analgesia, opioid stewardship, and safety.

---

## 1. Identify Anesthesia Pathway

At PACU arrival, confirm pathway from OR handoff:

- **Pathway 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
- **Pathway 2:** OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration)  
- **Pathway 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive  

Also confirm:

- Blocks performed and functioning (if applicable)  
- Intraoperative ketamine/dexmedetomidine use and timing  
- Last opioid dose (if any)

---

## 2. Standard Pain Assessment

At arrival and at regular intervals (e.g., q15–30 min):

- Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0–10 at rest and with gentle knee movement.  
- Document:
  - Pain score  
  - Sedation score  
  - Nausea/PONV status  
  - Vital signs (HR, BP, RR, SpO₂)

---

## 3. Baseline Multimodal Analgesia (All Pathways)

Unless contraindicated:

- Acetaminophen:
  - 1 g PO/IV q6h (max daily dose per institutional guidance)  
- NSAID (e.g., ketorolac or oral COX-2):
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day) **or**  
  - Continuation of scheduled celecoxib or meloxicam  

Ensure these are ordered and administered on schedule.

---

## 4. Pathway-Specific Pain Expectations

- **Pathway 1 (OFA + Blocks):**
  - Expected PACU NRS: 0–3/10  
  - If NRS >4, suspect:
    - Incomplete block  
    - Tourniquet-related pain  
    - Anxiety or positioning discomfort  

- **Pathway 2 (OFA, No Blocks):**
  - Expected PACU NRS: 3–6/10 in first 12 hours  
  - Pain may be more movement-related due to absence of ACB/IPACK.  

- **Pathway 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**
  - Pain and sedation more variable; anticipate:
    - Moderate pain  
    - Higher PONV and sedation risk  

---

## 5. Stepwise Rescue Algorithm (Text-Based Flow)

### Step 1 – Confirm Basics (All Pathways)

- Verify:
  - Multimodal meds given (acetaminophen, NSAID)  
  - Vital signs stable (MAP ≥65 mmHg, RR ≥10, SpO₂ ≥92%)  
  - No emergent cause of pain (compartment syndrome, ischemia, surgical complication)

If unstable or concerning exam → notify anesthesia and surgeon immediately.

---

### Step 2 – Non-Opioid Rescue (Preferred First-Line)

**Pathway 1 or 2 (OFA pathways):**

- If NRS ≥4 and sedation score acceptable:

  - **Ketamine bolus:**
    - 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV over 2–3 min  
    - May repeat q10–15 min, **max 3 doses** (total ~0.3–0.45 mg/kg)

- Consider ice application, limb elevation, and reassurance.

**Pathway 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**

- If NRS ≥4:
  - Ensure multimodal meds given; consider low-dose ketamine as above if allowed by institutional practice, especially in opioid-tolerant patients.

---

### Step 3 – Opioid Rescue (When Needed)

**OFA Pathways (1 and 2):**

- If NRS remains ≥4–5 after:
  - Scheduled multimodal +  
  - Up to 3 ketamine rescue doses  

  → Initiate **low-dose opioid rescue**, typically:

  - Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN  
    - Reassess after each dose  
    - Use minimal effective total dose  

**Conventional Pathway (3):**

- Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN  
- OR oral opioid (e.g., oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO) if tolerating oral intake and pain is stable.

In all cases:

- Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression.  
- Titrate cautiously in elderly, OSA, or frail patients.

---

### Step 4 – Reassessment and Escalation

After any rescue intervention:

- Reassess NRS, vital signs, and sedation score within 10–15 minutes.  
- If pain remains severe (NRS ≥7) or atypical, or if exam suggests complication:

  - Notify anesthesia attending and surgeon.  
  - Consider imaging or surgical evaluation as indicated.

---

## 6. PONV and Safety Considerations

- Standard PONV prophylaxis:
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV PRN  
  - Consider additional antiemetics (per institutional protocol) in high-risk patients.  

- Safety checks:
  - Continuous SpO₂ monitoring while receiving IV opioids or ketamine  
  - Naloxone immediately available for opioid-induced respiratory depression  
  - Lipid emulsion available for LAST if regional/local anesthetics used

---

## 7. Documentation Expectations

PACU documentation should include:

- Anesthesia pathway used  
- Blocks performed and quality (if applicable)  
- Pain scores and sedation scores at defined intervals  
- All rescue medications (dose, time, response)  
- Communication with anesthesia and surgery regarding uncontrolled pain or complications  
- Handoff summary to the ward, including:
  - Effective rescue strategies  
  - Ongoing multimodal plan  
  - Any patient-specific cautions (e.g., OSA, delirium risk)

# PACU Pain and Rescue Analgesia Algorithm  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This algorithm standardizes PACU pain assessment and rescue strategies across the three primary anesthesia pathways. It emphasizes multimodal analgesia, opioid stewardship, and safety.

---

## 1. Identify Anesthesia Pathway

At PACU arrival, confirm pathway from OR handoff:

- **Pathway 1:** OFIA + ACB/IPACK  
- **Pathway 2:** OFIA – Block-Free (surgeon periarticular infiltration)  
- **Pathway 3:** Conventional Opioid-Inclusive  

Also confirm:

- Blocks performed and functioning (if applicable)  
- Intraoperative ketamine/dexmedetomidine use and timing  
- Midazolam administration (standard anxiolytic in all pathways)
- Last opioid dose (if any)

---

## 2. Standard Pain Assessment

At arrival and at regular intervals (e.g., q15–30 min):

- Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0–10 at rest and with gentle knee movement.  
- Document:
  - Pain score  
  - Sedation score (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale or similar)
  - Nausea/PONV status  
  - Vital signs (HR, BP, RR, SpO₂)

---

## 3. Baseline Multimodal Analgesia (All Pathways)

Unless contraindicated:

- **Acetaminophen:**
  - 1 g PO/IV q6h (max 4 g/day per institutional guidance)  
- **NSAID** (e.g., ketorolac or oral COX-2):
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day, limit to 48–72h total) **or**  
  - Continuation of scheduled celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h or meloxicam 15 mg PO daily  

Ensure these are ordered and administered on schedule.

---

## 4. Pathway-Specific Pain Expectations

- **Pathway 1 (OFIA + Blocks):**
  - Expected PACU NRS: **0–3/10**  
  - If NRS >4, suspect:
    - Incomplete block  
    - Tourniquet-related pain  
    - Anxiety or positioning discomfort  
    - Consider block assessment/documentation

- **Pathway 2 (OFIA, No Blocks):**
  - Expected PACU NRS: **3–6/10** in first 12 hours  
  - Pain may be more movement-related due to absence of ACB/IPACK  
  - Relies on periarticular infiltration by surgeon

- **Pathway 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**
  - Pain and sedation more variable; anticipate:
    - Moderate pain (NRS 2–5/10)
    - Higher PONV and sedation risk  
    - More careful respiratory monitoring required

---

## 5. Stepwise Rescue Algorithm (Text-Based Flow)

### Step 1 – Confirm Basics (All Pathways)

- Verify:
  - Multimodal meds given (acetaminophen, NSAID)  
  - Vital signs stable (MAP ≥65 mmHg, RR ≥10, SpO₂ ≥92%)  
  - No emergent cause of pain (compartment syndrome, ischemia, surgical complication)
  - Adequate reversal from neuromuscular blockade (if applicable)

If unstable or concerning exam → notify anesthesia and surgeon immediately.

---

### Step 2 – Non-Opioid Rescue (Preferred First-Line)

**Pathway 1 or 2 (OFIA pathways):**

- If NRS ≥4 and sedation score acceptable:

  - **Ketamine bolus:**
    - 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV over 2–3 min  
    - May repeat q10–15 min, **max 3 doses** (total ~0.3–0.45 mg/kg)
    - Monitor for dissociation, dysphoria (rare at these doses)

- **Non-pharmacologic interventions:**
  - Ice application to surgical site  
  - Limb elevation and positioning  
  - Reassurance and anxiety management

**Pathway 3 (Opioid-Inclusive):**

- If NRS ≥4:
  - Ensure multimodal meds given
  - Consider low-dose ketamine as above if allowed by institutional practice, especially in opioid-tolerant patients
  - May proceed directly to opioid rescue if appropriate

---

### Step 3 – Opioid Rescue (When Needed)

**OFIA Pathways (1 and 2):**

- If NRS remains ≥4–5 after:
  - Scheduled multimodal +  
  - Up to 3 ketamine rescue doses  

  → Initiate **low-dose opioid rescue**, typically:

  - **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN**  
    - Reassess pain, sedation, and respiratory status after each dose  
    - Use minimal effective total dose  
    - Consider patient-specific factors (age, weight, renal function, OSA)

**Conventional Pathway (3):**

- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN**  
- **OR** oral opioid (e.g., oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO) if:
  - Tolerating oral intake  
  - Pain is stable/improving  
  - No nausea/vomiting

**In all cases:**

- Monitor continuously for sedation and respiratory depression  
- Use capnography if available, especially in high-risk patients  
- Titrate cautiously in elderly, OSA, frail patients, or those with significant comorbidities
- Naloxone 0.4 mg IV immediately available

---

### Step 4 – Reassessment and Escalation

After any rescue intervention:

- Reassess NRS, vital signs, and sedation score within **10–15 minutes**  
- If pain remains severe (NRS ≥7) or escalating, or if exam suggests complication:

  - **Notify anesthesia attending and surgeon immediately**  
  - Consider:
    - Block failure or inadequate coverage (Pathway 1)
    - Surgical complication (hematoma, compartment syndrome)
    - Imaging or urgent surgical evaluation as indicated

- Document response to interventions and any concerns

---

## 6. PONV and Safety Considerations

### PONV Management
- **Standard prophylaxis:**
  - Ondansetron 4 mg IV PRN (q6h max)  
  - Consider additional antiemetics in high-risk patients:
    - Promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg IV (caution: sedation)
    - Metoclopramide 10 mg IV (if no contraindication)
    - Dexamethasone (typically given intraoperatively)

### Safety Monitoring
- **Continuous SpO₂** monitoring while receiving IV opioids or ketamine  
- Consider capnography for high-risk patients (OSA, obesity, elderly)
- **Naloxone 0.4 mg IV** immediately available for opioid-induced respiratory depression  
- **Lipid emulsion 20%** available for LAST if regional/local anesthetics used
- Monitor for signs of LAST: perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste, agitation

## 7. Documentation Expectations

PACU documentation should include:

- Anesthesia pathway used (1, 2, or 3)
- Blocks performed and quality/coverage (if applicable)  
- Midazolam administration and response
- Pain scores (NRS) and sedation scores at defined intervals  
- All rescue medications administered:
  - Drug, dose, route, time  
  - Patient response (pain score, vital signs, adverse effects)
- Communication with anesthesia and surgery regarding:
  - Uncontrolled pain  
  - Complications or concerns  
  - Block assessment if inadequate analgesia
- Handoff summary to the ward, including:
  - Effective rescue strategies used  
  - Ongoing multimodal analgesic plan  
  - Scheduled medications and timing  
  - Any patient-specific cautions (e.g., OSA, delirium risk, frailty)
  - Total opioid consumption in PACU (if any)

---

## 8. Special Population Considerations

### Elderly/Frail Patients (>70 years)
- Reduce ketamine to **0.1 mg/kg** maximum per dose
- Start opioids at **50% of standard dose** (hydromorphone 0.1 mg)
- Extended monitoring for delayed respiratory depression

### OSA/Respiratory Disease
- Prefer multimodal/ketamine over opioids
- Continuous capnography if available
- Consider ICU/step-down monitoring if significant opioid requirements

### Opioid-Tolerant Patients
- Higher ketamine doses may be appropriate (up to 0.15 mg/kg)
- Opioid rescue likely needed sooner
- Coordinate with pain management service if available

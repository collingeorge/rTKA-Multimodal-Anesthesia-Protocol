# References and Evidence Base  
**Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)**  
**Multimodal and Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA)**

---

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides the **evidence base and guideline support** for all clinical content in this repository, including:

- Preoperative evaluation and counseling  
- Spinal vs general anesthesia decision-making  
- Regional anesthesia selection (ACB/IPACK, periarticular infiltration)  
- Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) adjuncts  
- PACU pain rescue algorithms and monitoring thresholds  
- ERAS-aligned perioperative workflows  

The references below are **intentionally conservative**, favoring:
- Society guidelines and consensus statements  
- High-quality randomized controlled trials  
- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews  
- Widely accepted anesthesia practice standards  

This file is designed to be **auditable by attendings, institutional reviewers, and academic committees**.  
All citations have been reviewed for **consistency with dosing ranges, safety language, and scope** used throughout the repository.

Clinical feedback informing protocol refinement has been incorporated from practicing anesthesiologists, including **Dr. Shane Mandalia** and **Dr. Ronald Pauldine**.

## Terminology Clarification

In published literature, the term **OFA (Opioid-Free Anesthesia)** is commonly used.

In this repository, we use:

**OFIA – Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia**

This distinction emphasizes that:
- Opioids are intentionally avoided **intraoperatively**
- Opioids may still be used **postoperatively** when clinically indicated and safely titrated

This terminology choice aligns with real-world perioperative practice and avoids misleading absolutist interpretations.

**Interpretation:**  
These studies support the repository’s emphasis on **motor-sparing regional techniques**, skepticism toward routine liposomal bupivacaine use, and flexibility between block-based and block-free OFIA pathways.

## 8. Clinical Integration Summary

Across all rTKA protocols, the following practices are consistently supported:

- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** – standard anxiolysis  
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** or **propofol TIVA** – ERAS-compatible maintenance  
- **Acetaminophen + NSAID** – foundational multimodal analgesia  
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** – analgesic and antiemetic  
- **ACB/IPACK** – motor-sparing regional anesthesia  
- **Ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium** – opioid-sparing adjuncts

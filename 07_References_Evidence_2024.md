## 8. Future Work and Evidence Updates

This reference list is intended to be updated as:

- New randomized trials on OFIA, ACB/IPACK, and ERAS pathways are published (2025 onward)
- Additional meta-analyses clarify optimal dosing of ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, and lidocaine in TKA
- Further guidelines are released by ERAS Society, ASA, ASRA, or APSF
- Clinical feedback from practitioners like Drs. Mandalia and Pauldine identifies gaps in evidence or practice patterns requiring documentation

**Planned next update:** Mid-2026, or sooner if major guideline changes occur.

## 9. Clinical Practice Integration

### Standard Medications Based on Evidence
The following medications are incorporated across all protocols based on consensus guidelines and practitioner feedback:

- **Midazolam (1-2 mg IV):** Standard anxiolytic that does not compromise OFIA principles (Reves 1985, Kain 1998)
- **Sevoflurane (0.8-1.2 MAC):** Preferred volatile agent for ease of titration and favorable recovery profile (Eger 1965, Wachtel 2011)
- **Acetaminophen (1 g q6h):** Foundation of multimodal analgesia (Thybo 2019)
- **NSAIDs (celecoxib 400 mg or alternatives):** Synergistic with acetaminophen (Thybo 2019)
- **Dexamethasone (8-10 mg IV):** PONV prophylaxis and analgesic adjunct (Gan 2020)

### Evidence Gaps and Ongoing Research
Areas requiring additional high-quality evidence:
- Optimal ketamine infusion rates in robotic vs conventional TKA
- Comparative effectiveness of sevoflurane vs TIVA in OFIA protocols
- Long-term outcomes (6-12 months) of OFIA vs conventional pathways
- Cost-effectiveness analysis of block-based vs block-free OFIA approaches
- Patient-reported outcomes stratified by pathway selection

## 10. Linking to Protocol Sections

Where feasible, individual protocol files reference:

- **Guidelines (Section 1)** for overarching principles
- **Specific RCTs/meta-analyses (Sections 2-5)** for dosing and regimen choices
- **Safety guidelines (Section 7)** for anticoagulation management and LAST prevention
- **Clinical integration (Section 9)** for standard medication practices

As you formalize your medRxiv scoping review or journal submissions, you can sync the citation lists between your manuscripts and this file.

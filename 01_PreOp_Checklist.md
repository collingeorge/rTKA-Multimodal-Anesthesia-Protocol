# Preoperative Anesthesia Checklist
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### Version 1.4 — December 2025

A standardized, ERAS-aligned preoperative workflow for patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. This checklist integrates three anesthesia pathways (**OFIA + blocks**, **OFIA block-free**, **conventional opioid-inclusive**) and supports safety, readiness, and interdisciplinary communication.

**Educational use only. Not validated. Not institutional policy. Requires attending anesthesiologist oversight.**

---

# 1. Patient Verification
- [ ] Confirm **patient identity** with two identifiers
- [ ] Confirm **procedure**, laterality, surgeon
- [ ] Verify **signed consent** (surgery, anesthesia, regional anesthesia if applicable)
- [ ] Confirm time-out readiness

---

# 2. Medical & Anesthesia Evaluation
- [ ] Review medical history, H&P, prior anesthetic records, prior airway/PONV history
- [ ] Assign **ASA classification**
- [ ] Airway exam: Mallampati, mouth opening, TMD, neck ROM, dentition
- [ ] Functional capacity (METs); document if **<4 METs**
- [ ] Allergies/intolerances reviewed (local anesthetics, NSAIDs, opioids, antibiotics, latex)
- [ ] PONV risk assessed (Apfel factors; identify high-risk phenotype)
- [ ] Frailty/cognition screen for age **>70** or frailty phenotype (delirium risk)
- [ ] Opioid tolerance assessed; calculate daily **MME** if chronic user
- [ ] High-risk comorbidities screened/documented:
  - [ ] OSA (STOP-Bang; home CPAP/BiPAP plan)
  - [ ] Dementia/cognitive impairment or prior delirium
  - [ ] Severe anxiety/PTSD history (agent selection implications)
  - [ ] CAD/CHF/arrhythmias/valvular disease (note fixed-output lesions)
  - [ ] Chronic lung disease (home O₂, hypercapnia, prior post-op respiratory failure)
- [ ] Infection/COVID status per institutional policy

---

# 3. Anticoagulation & Block Safety (ASRA/ESRA 2024–2025 + Institutional Policy)
For this repository, ACB/IPACK are treated as **deep peripheral blocks** and require **ASRA/ESRA-consistent timing** and institutional policy adherence.

- [ ] **Anticoagulation/antiplatelet regimen reconciled**
  - last dose timing documented
  - renal function documented when relevant (DOAC clearance)
- [ ] Timing verified using **current institutional table** aligned with ASRA/ESRA
- [ ] **Block plan determined**
  - [ ] Within timing window → proceed if clinically appropriate
  - [ ] Not within timing window → document reason and select **Pathway 2 (OFIA block-free)** or **Pathway 3**

### Common timing checkpoints (institution-dependent; verify with local table)
**DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban):**
- [ ] Hold **≥72 hours** if CrCl >50 mL/min
- [ ] Hold **≥120 hours** if CrCl <50 mL/min

**Dabigatran:**
- [ ] Hold **72–120 hours** depending on renal function

**LMWH:**
- [ ] Therapeutic dosing: hold **≥24 hours**
- [ ] Prophylactic dosing: hold **≥12 hours**

**Warfarin:**
- [ ] Day-of INR verified; proceed only if INR within institutional cutoff (commonly **≤1.4** for deep blocks)

**Antiplatelets:**
- [ ] Aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor status documented
- [ ] Deep block timing for P2Y12 inhibitors verified per institutional policy
- [ ] If timing not met → avoid deep blocks; proceed with block-free strategy

- [ ] VTE prophylaxis plan confirmed with surgeon; restart timing communicated to PACU/floor

---

# 4. Required Preoperative Testing (Indication-Based; ERAS Principle)
- [ ] CBC if age >65, anemia risk, significant comorbidity, or clinical indication
- [ ] Electrolytes + **creatinine** (DOAC clearance; magnesium suitability; risk stratification)
- [ ] ECG for age ≥50 or cardiac history/symptoms
- [ ] Pregnancy test per institutional policy
- [ ] Coagulation studies only if on warfarin, liver disease, bleeding history, or clinical indication
- [ ] Avoid routine testing unless indicated

---

# 5. ERAS-Aligned Preoperative Medications
- [ ] **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op; adjust max daily dose to phenotype)
- [ ] **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hr pre-op) if no contraindication  
  - Alternative: meloxicam 15 mg PO (institution-dependent)  
  - Avoid NSAID “stacking” (follow institutional plan)
- [ ] **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** (anticipate hyperglycemia in diabetics)
- [ ] **Scopolamine patch** ≥2 hours pre-op (**high PONV-risk only**, per policy)
- [ ] **Midazolam** as clinically appropriate:
  - Typical: **1–2 mg IV**
  - Elderly/OSA/frail/high delirium risk: consider **0.5–1 mg**, or avoid
- [ ] Avoid routine **gabapentinoids** (sedation/falls/respiratory risk signal; follow policy)
- [ ] Chronic opioid users: continue baseline home opioids per institutional practice
- [ ] Metformin hold status verified per institutional policy

---

# 6. Fasting & Hydration (ASA-Aligned)
- [ ] Clear liquids up to **2 hours** before induction
- [ ] Solids stopped **≥6 hours** (or per institutional policy)
- [ ] Optional carbohydrate drink 2–3 hours pre-op if allowed (avoid in gastroparesis/poorly controlled diabetes per policy)
- [ ] Hydration assessed; avoid hypovolemia
- [ ] Patent IV; crystalloid available

---

# 7. Anesthesia Plan & Patient Counseling (Shared Decision-Making)
- [ ] Discuss pathway options:
  - Pathway 1: **OFIA + ACB/IPACK** (preferred when safe/feasible)
  - Pathway 2: **OFIA block-free** (contraindication/refusal/feasibility)
  - Pathway 3: **conventional opioid-inclusive**
- [ ] Discuss neuraxial vs GA if both appropriate; document rationale
- [ ] Review expected pain profile and PACU expectations by pathway
- [ ] ERAS goals: early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, opioid minimization
- [ ] Final pathway selected and documented (contraindications/preferences driving decision)

---

# 8. Regional Anesthesia Preparation (If Performing ACB/IPACK)

### Adductor Canal Block (ACB)
- [ ] US-guided with linear probe
- [ ] Ropivacaine **0.2–0.25%**, **20–30 mL**
- [ ] Sensory-dominant, quadriceps-sparing intent

### IPACK Block
- [ ] US-guided
- [ ] Ropivacaine **0.2–0.25%**, **15–20 mL** (typical)
- [ ] Posterior capsule sensory coverage

### Block Safety

- [ ] Incremental injection with frequent aspiration
- [ ] Stop if paresthesia/pain on injection
- [ ] **Total local anesthetic dose documented** (ACB + IPACK + infiltration)
- [ ] **20% lipid emulsion immediately available**

# 9. Intraoperative Adjuncts Prepared (Pathway-Aligned)

## OFIA Pathways (1 & 2)
- [ ] Ketamine induction **0.2–0.5 mg/kg**
  - 0.3–0.5 mg/kg: robust physiology / opioid tolerance
  - 0.2–0.3 mg/kg: frail/cardiac risk/OSA phenotype
- [ ] Ketamine infusion: **0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr**
- [ ] Dexmedetomidine infusion: **0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr** (lower starting range in frail/bradycardic phenotype; avoid loading dose in high-risk)
- [ ] Magnesium sulfate **30–50 mg/kg IV** over ≥15–20 min  
  - Avoid in CrCl <30 mL/min and myasthenia gravis
- [ ] **Lidocaine infusion (Pathway 2 only; adjunct-only)**
  - **1–2 mg/kg/hr**, initiated **after induction**
  - Use **only in conjunction with ketamine-based OFIA**
  - Not used as monotherapy; low pH can cause infusion discomfort if inadequately anesthetized
  - Screen contraindications and monitor for toxicity; apply protocol total-dose cap
- [ ] Maintenance (repository standard):
  - [ ] **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (baseline maintenance)
  - [ ] ± Sevoflurane **0.8–1.2 MAC** (optional hybrid/transition/institutional preference)

## Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Pathway (3)
- [ ] Induction opioid: fentanyl **1–2 mcg/kg** and/or hydromorphone **0.2–0.4 mg** (titrate)
- [ ] **If opioids continued intraoperatively:** fentanyl infusion typical **0.5–2 mcg/kg/hr** (titrate to effect; reduce in elderly/OSA/frail)

## Equipment
- [ ] Ultrasound ready (if blocks planned)
- [ ] Block needles and backup supplies available
- [ ] Infusion pumps available (OFIA pathways)

# Preoperative Anesthesia Checklist  
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)  
### Version 1.2 — December 2025

A standardized, ERAS-aligned preoperative workflow for patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. This checklist integrates the three rTKA anesthesia pathways (OFIA with blocks, OFIA block-free, and conventional opioid-inclusive) and ensures readiness, safety, and clear interdisciplinary communication.

---

# 1. Patient Verification
- [ ] Confirm **patient identity** with two identifiers  
- [ ] Confirm **procedure**, laterality, and surgeon  
- [ ] Verify **signed consent** (surgery, anesthesia, regional anesthesia if applicable)  
- [ ] Time-out readiness confirmed  

---

# 2. Medical & Anesthesia Evaluation
- [ ] Review medical history, H&P, and previous anesthesia records  
- [ ] Assign **ASA classification**  
- [ ] Perform airway exam (Mallampati, mouth opening, thyromental distance, neck ROM)  
- [ ] Assess **functional capacity (METs ≥4)**; document if <4  
- [ ] Review allergies (local anesthetics, NSAIDs, opioids)  
- [ ] Assess **PONV risk** (female, non-smoker, prior PONV, motion sickness)  
- [ ] Frailty/cognition evaluation (high importance age >70)  
- [ ] Determine **opioid tolerance**; calculate daily MME if chronic user  
- [ ] Screen for high-risk comorbidities:
  - [ ] OSA (STOP-Bang documented; CPAP use confirmed)  
  - [ ] Dementia or cognitive impairment  
  - [ ] Severe baseline anxiety  
  - [ ] CAD/CHF/arrhythmias  
  - [ ] Chronic lung disease  
- [ ] Review infection/COVID status per institutional policy  

---

# 3. Anticoagulation & Block Safety (ASRA 2024–2025)
Nerve blocks for rTKA (ACB/IPACK) are treated as **deep peripheral blocks**, requiring neuraxial-like timing.

**DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban):**
- [ ] Hold **≥72 hours** if CrCl >50 mL/min  
- [ ] Hold **≥120 hours** if CrCl <50 mL/min  

**Dabigatran:**  
- [ ] Hold 72–120 hours depending on renal function  

**LMWH:**  
- [ ] Therapeutic dosing: hold ≥24 hours  
- [ ] Prophylactic dosing: hold ≥12 hours  

**Warfarin:**  
- [ ] INR ≤1.4 for deep blocks  

**Antiplatelets:**  
- [ ] Aspirin/clopidogrel documented (generally safe for ACB/IPACK per ASRA)  

- [ ] **Block plan determined:** ACB/IPACK safe → proceed  
- [ ] If blocks contraindicated → reason documented + select **OFIA Block-Free** pathway  
- [ ] VTE prophylaxis plan confirmed with surgeon  

---

# 4. Required Preoperative Testing
- [ ] CBC if age >65, anemia risk, or cardiac disease  
- [ ] Electrolytes + **creatinine** (required for DOAC clearance, magnesium dosing)  
- [ ] ECG for age ≥50 or cardiac history  
- [ ] Pregnancy test per institutional policy  
- [ ] Coagulation studies only if on warfarin or bleeding history  
- [ ] Avoid routine labs unless indicated (ERAS principle)  

---

# 5. ERAS-Aligned Preoperative Medications
- [ ] **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op)  
- [ ] **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hr pre-op)  
  - Alternative: **Meloxicam 15 mg** if celecoxib contraindicated  
- [ ] **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** (after IV placement)  
- [ ] **Scopolamine patch** ≥2 hours pre-op (high PONV risk)  
- [ ] **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** for anxiolysis (standard; OFIA-compatible)  
- [ ] Avoid **gabapentinoids** (ASA/APSF 2024 — ↑ sedation & delirium risk)  
- [ ] Chronic opioid users: continue **home morning opioid dose**  
- [ ] Hold metformin morning of surgery (institution-dependent)  

---

# 6. Fasting & Hydration
- [ ] Clear liquids up to **2 hr** before induction  
- [ ] Solids stopped ≥6 hr (per ASA fasting guidelines)  
- [ ] Optional carb drink 2–3 hr pre-op (unless diabetic/gastroparesis)  
- [ ] Assess hydration; avoid hypovolemia  
- [ ] Patent IV with crystalloid running  

---

# 7. Anesthesia Plan & Patient Counseling
- [ ] Discuss **three pathway options**:
  - Pathway 1: **OFIA + ACB/IPACK** (preferred ERAS pathway)  
  - Pathway 2: **OFIA Block-Free** (contraindications/refusal)  
  - Pathway 3: **Conventional Opioid-Inclusive**  
- [ ] Discuss spinal vs general anesthesia (if both appropriate)  
- [ ] Review expected pain profile per pathway  
- [ ] Explain ERAS goals: early mobilization, minimal opioids, multimodal analgesia  
- [ ] Document **shared decision-making** and final pathway selected  
- [ ] Document GA vs spinal decision + rationale  

---

# 8. Regional Anesthesia Preparation (If Performing ACB/IPACK)

# Preoperative Anesthesia Checklist

## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### 2025 Edition

A standardized, ERAS-aligned preoperative workflow for patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Designed for anesthesia clinicians, surgeons, OR staff, and PACU teams to ensure safety, consistency, and evidence-based practice.

## 1. Patient Verification

- [ ] **Confirm patient identity** using 2 identifiers
- [ ] **Confirm procedure**, laterality, and surgeon
- [ ] **Review consent** (surgery + anesthesia + regional blocks if applicable)
- [ ] **Time-out readiness** verified

---

## 2. Medical and Anesthesia Evaluation

- [ ] Review medical history, H&P, and prior anesthesia record
- [ ] Assign **ASA classification**
- [ ] Airway exam (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, ROM)
- [ ] Functional capacity (**METs ≥4** or document if <4)
- [ ] Allergies reviewed
- [ ] PONV risk factors reviewed (female, non-smoker, history of motion sickness, opioids)
- [ ] **Delirium/frailty assessment** (especially age >70)
- [ ] Opioid tolerance status: opioid-naïve vs chronic user
- [ ] High-risk factors identified (OSA, cognitive impairment, severe anxiety)
- [ ] Infection/COVID status if required by institutional policy

---

## 3. Anticoagulation and Block Safety (ASRA 2024-2025)

- [ ] Review DOACs, warfarin, LMWH, and antiplatelets
- [ ] Apply **ASRA 2024 guidelines** (deep peripheral blocks treated like neuraxial):
  
  **DOACs (rivaroxaban/apixaban):**
  - [ ] **≥72 hours** since last dose (CrCl >50 mL/min)
  - [ ] Adjust if renal impairment
  
  **LMWH therapeutic dosing:**
  - [ ] Hold 24 hours
  
  **Warfarin:**
  - [ ] INR <1.5 for deep blocks

- [ ] Confirm ACB/IPACK safety and document decision
- [ ] VTE prophylaxis plan reviewed with surgeon (optional)

---

## 4. Required Preoperative Testing

- [ ] CBC (if anemia risk, age >65, cardiac disease)
- [ ] Electrolytes + **creatinine** (essential for DOAC clearance)
- [ ] ECG for age ≥50 or cardiac history
- [ ] Pregnancy test (per institutional policy)
- [ ] Additional testing **only if indicated** (ERAS principle: avoid unnecessary labs)

---

## 5. ERAS-Aligned Preoperative Medications

- [ ] **Acetaminophen 1 g PO**
- [ ] **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (or meloxicam 15 mg if celecoxib contraindicated)
- [ ] **Dexamethasone 8-10 mg IV**
- [ ] **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** (apply night before or ≥2 hours pre-op for high PONV risk)
- [ ] **Avoid gabapentinoids** (gabapentin/pregabalin) — ↑ sedation, ↑ delirium, no OFA benefit
- [ ] Chronic opioid patient? Continue home opioid dose morning of surgery (if prescribed)

---

## 6. Fasting and Hydration Status

- [ ] Clear liquids allowed up to **2 hours pre-op**
- [ ] Solids stopped per ASA fasting guidelines
- [ ] Optional **carbohydrate load**: 200-400 mL clear carb drink (unless diabetic)
- [ ] Assess hydration status (avoid dehydration before neuraxial anesthesia)

---

## 7. Anesthesia Plan and Patient Counseling

- [ ] Discuss **three anesthesia pathways** (OFA + blocks, OFA no blocks, conventional)
- [ ] Answer patient questions and confirm understanding
- [ ] Document **shared decision-making**
- [ ] Review ERAS goals: early ambulation, reduced opioids, multimodal analgesia
- [ ] Confirm patient preference for **GA vs spinal**
- [ ] Document decision + rationale

---

## 8. Regional Anesthesia Preparation (If Applicable)

**Adductor Canal Block (ACB):**
- [ ] Ultrasound-guided
- [ ] Ropivacaine **0.2-0.25%**, **20-30 mL**

**IPACK Block:**
- [ ] Ultrasound-guided
- [ ] Ropivacaine **0.2-0.25%**, **20 mL**

**Additional safety checks:**
- [ ] No vascular puncture
- [ ] Negative aspiration
- [ ] No intraneural injection
- [ ] Document sensory change (no motor block expected)

---

## 9. Intraoperative Adjuncts Prepared

- [ ] **Ketamine**: 0.3-0.5 mg/kg induction; infusion 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/hr if used
- [ ] **Dexmedetomidine**: optional loading ≤0.5 μg/kg over 20 minutes, then 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/hr
- [ ] **Magnesium sulfate**: 30-50 mg/kg over 15-20 minutes
- [ ] **Lidocaine infusion** (optional): 1-2 mg/kg/hr if **no regional blocks**
- [ ] Equipment: ultrasound, nerve stimulator, block needles, monitoring
- [ ] Pharmacy notified for dexmedetomidine/ketamine/magnesium

---

## 10. Interdisciplinary Communication

- [ ] **Surgeon**: local infiltration plan, tourniquet duration, expected blood loss
- [ ] **PACU**: expected postoperative pain (based on chosen pathway)
- [ ] **OR nursing**: airway plan, patient positioning
- [ ] **PT/Ortho floor**: early mobilization expectations

---

## 11. Preoperative Documentation

- [ ] Regional anesthesia consent
- [ ] Anesthesia plan note
- [ ] Block documentation
- [ ] Pre-op vitals
- [ ] Pregnancy test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Timeout checklist readiness

---

## 12. Ready for Transport to OR

- [ ] Forced-air warming device applied (prevents hypothermia/PONV)
- [ ] IV patent; fluids running
- [ ] Monitoring applied or ready
- [ ] Regional block updates communicated to surgeon and PACU
- [ ] Patient comfortable and stable

---

## Evidence Base

This checklist is derived from:

# Preoperative Anesthesia Checklist
## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)
### Version 1.3 — December 2025

A standardized, ERAS-aligned preoperative workflow for patients undergoing robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. This checklist integrates three anesthesia pathways (OFIA + blocks, OFIA block-free, and conventional opioid-inclusive) and supports safety, readiness, and interdisciplinary communication.

**Educational use only. Not validated. Not institutional policy. Requires attending anesthesiologist oversight.**

---

# 1. Patient Verification
- [ ] Confirm **patient identity** with two identifiers
- [ ] Confirm **procedure**, laterality, and surgeon
- [ ] Verify **signed consent** (surgery, anesthesia, regional anesthesia if applicable)
- [ ] Time-out readiness confirmed

---

# 2. Medical & Anesthesia Evaluation
- [ ] Review medical history, H&P, prior anesthetic records, and prior PONV/airway history
- [ ] Assign **ASA classification**
- [ ] Airway exam: Mallampati, mouth opening, thyromental distance, neck ROM, dentition
- [ ] Functional capacity (METs): document if **<4 METs**
- [ ] Allergies/intolerances reviewed (local anesthetics, NSAIDs, opioids, antibiotics, latex)
- [ ] PONV risk assessed (Apfel factors; note high-risk phenotype)
- [ ] Frailty/cognition screen for age **>70** or frailty phenotype (delirium risk)
- [ ] Opioid tolerance assessed; calculate daily MME if chronic user
- [ ] High-risk comorbidities screened/documented:
  - [ ] OSA (STOP-Bang; CPAP/BiPAP use and plan for periop use)
  - [ ] Dementia/cognitive impairment or prior delirium
  - [ ] Severe baseline anxiety or PTSD history (ketamine/dexmed considerations)
  - [ ] CAD/CHF/arrhythmias/valvular disease
  - [ ] Chronic lung disease (home O₂, hypercapnia, prior post-op respiratory failure)
- [ ] Infection/COVID status per institutional policy

---

# 3. Anticoagulation & Block Safety (ASRA 2024–2025 + Institutional Policy)
For this repository, ACB/IPACK are treated as **deep peripheral blocks** and require **ASRA-consistent, neuraxial-like timing** and institutional policy adherence.

- [ ] **Anticoagulation/antiplatelet regimen fully reconciled**
  - last dose time documented
  - renal function documented when relevant (e.g., DOAC clearance)
- [ ] **Timing verified using current institutional table aligned with ASRA (2024–2025)**
- [ ] **Block plan determined:**
  - [ ] ACB/IPACK within timing window → proceed if clinically appropriate
  - [ ] Not within timing window → document reason and select **OFIA Block-Free** pathway (or alternative)

### Common timing checkpoints (institution-dependent; verify with local table)
**DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban):**
- [ ] Hold **≥72 hours** if CrCl >50 mL/min
- [ ] Hold **≥120 hours** if CrCl <50 mL/min

**Dabigatran:**
- [ ] Hold **72–120 hours** depending on renal function

**LMWH:**
- [ ] Therapeutic dosing: hold **≥24 hours**
- [ ] Prophylactic dosing: hold **≥12 hours**

**Warfarin:**
- [ ] Day-of INR verified; target **INR ≤1.4** for deep blocks per institutional policy

**Antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors):**
- [ ] Aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor status documented
- [ ] **Deep block timing for P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel) verified per ASRA + institutional policy**
- [ ] If timing not met → avoid deep blocks and proceed with block-free strategy

- [ ] VTE prophylaxis plan confirmed with surgeon (restart timing communicated to PACU/floor)

---

# 4. Required Preoperative Testing (Indication-Based; ERAS Principle)
- [ ] CBC if age >65, anemia risk, significant comorbidity, or clinical indication
- [ ] Electrolytes + **creatinine** (DOAC clearance, magnesium suitability, general risk stratification)
- [ ] ECG for age ≥50 or cardiac history/symptoms
- [ ] Pregnancy test per institutional policy
- [ ] Coagulation studies only if on warfarin, liver disease, bleeding history, or clinical indication
- [ ] Avoid routine testing unless indicated

---

# 5. ERAS-Aligned Preoperative Medications
- [ ] **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op; adjust max daily dose to phenotype)
- [ ] **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hr pre-op) if no contraindication
  - Alternative: **meloxicam 15 mg PO** (institution-dependent)
- [ ] **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** (after IV placement; anticipate hyperglycemia in diabetics)
- [ ] **Scopolamine patch** ≥2 hours pre-op (**high PONV-risk only**)
- [ ] **Midazolam** for anxiolysis **as clinically appropriate**:
  - Typical: **1–2 mg IV**
  - OSA/frail/elderly: consider **≤1 mg** or avoid in high delirium-risk phenotype
- [ ] Avoid routine **gabapentinoids** (sedation/falls/respiratory risk signal in older/high-risk phenotypes)
- [ ] Chronic opioid users: continue **baseline home opioid regimen** per institutional practice
- [ ] Metformin hold status verified **per institutional policy** (not universal)

---

# 6. Fasting & Hydration (ASA-Aligned)
- [ ] Clear liquids up to **2 hours** before induction
- [ ] Solids stopped **≥6 hours** (or per institutional fasting policy)
- [ ] Optional carbohydrate drink 2–3 hours pre-op if allowed (avoid in gastroparesis/poorly controlled diabetes per policy)
- [ ] Hydration assessed; avoid hypovolemia
- [ ] Patent IV; crystalloid available

---

# 7. Anesthesia Plan & Patient Counseling (Shared Decision-Making)
- [ ] Discuss three pathway options:
  - Pathway 1: **OFIA + ACB/IPACK** (preferred when safe/feasible)
  - Pathway 2: **OFIA Block-Free** (contraindication/refusal/feasibility)
  - Pathway 3: **Conventional Opioid-Inclusive**
- [ ] Discuss neuraxial vs GA if both are institutionally appropriate (document rationale)
- [ ] Review expected pain profile and PACU expectations by pathway
- [ ] ERAS goals reviewed: early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, opioid minimization
- [ ] Final pathway selected and documented (including contraindications/preferences driving decision)

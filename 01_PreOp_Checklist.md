## 1. Patient Verification

- [ ] **Confirm patient identity** using 2 identifiers
- [ ] **Confirm procedure**, laterality, and surgeon
- [ ] **Review consent** (surgery + anesthesia + regional blocks if applicable)
- [ ] **Time-out readiness** verified

---

## 2. Medical and Anesthesia Evaluation

- [ ] Review medical history, H&P, and prior anesthesia record
- [ ] Assign **ASA classification**
- [ ] Airway exam (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck ROM)
- [ ] Functional capacity (**METs ≥4** or document if <4)
- [ ] Allergies reviewed (including local anesthetics, NSAIDs, opioids)
- [ ] PONV risk factors reviewed (female, non-smoker, history of motion sickness, prior PONV with opioids)
- [ ] **Delirium/frailty assessment** (especially age >70; consider baseline cognitive screening)
- [ ] Opioid tolerance status: opioid-naïve vs chronic user (document MME if chronic)
- [ ] High-risk factors identified:
  - [ ] OSA (STOP-Bang score documented)
  - [ ] Cognitive impairment or dementia
  - [ ] Severe anxiety requiring additional counseling
  - [ ] Cardiac disease (CHF, CAD, arrhythmias)
  - [ ] Respiratory disease (COPD, asthma, restrictive lung disease)
- [ ] Infection/COVID status if required by institutional policy

---

## 3. Anticoagulation and Block Safety (ASRA 2024-2025)

- [ ] Review DOACs, warfarin, LMWH, and antiplatelets
- [ ] Apply **ASRA 2024 guidelines** (deep peripheral blocks treated like neuraxial):
  
  **DOACs (rivaroxaban/apixaban/edoxaban):**
  - [ ] **≥72 hours** since last dose (CrCl >50 mL/min)
  - [ ] **≥120 hours** if CrCl <50 mL/min
  - [ ] Adjust for renal impairment
  
  **Dabigatran:**
  - [ ] 72-120 hours depending on renal function
  
  **LMWH therapeutic dosing:**
  - [ ] Hold ≥24 hours
  
  **LMWH prophylactic dosing:**
  - [ ] Hold ≥12 hours
  
  **Warfarin:**
  - [ ] INR ≤1.4 for deep blocks/neuraxial
  
  **Antiplatelets:**
  - [ ] Document aspirin/clopidogrel/ticagrelor status
  - [ ] Generally safe for peripheral blocks per ASRA

- [ ] Confirm ACB/IPACK safety and document decision
- [ ] If blocks contraindicated, document reason and select block-free pathway
- [ ] VTE prophylaxis plan reviewed with surgeon

---

## 4. Required Preoperative Testing

- [ ] CBC (if anemia risk, age >65, cardiac disease, or concern for bleeding disorder)
- [ ] Electrolytes + **creatinine** (essential for DOAC clearance and magnesium dosing)
- [ ] ECG for age ≥50 or cardiac history
- [ ] Pregnancy test (per institutional policy for reproductive-age patients)
- [ ] Additional testing **only if indicated** (ERAS principle: avoid unnecessary labs)
- [ ] Coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) only if on warfarin or bleeding history

---

## 5. ERAS-Aligned Preoperative Medications

- [ ] **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (give 30-60 min pre-op; peak effect 45-60 min)
- [ ] **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (give 1-2 hours pre-op; provides 24h coverage)
  - [ ] Alternative: Meloxicam 15 mg PO if celecoxib contraindicated
- [ ] **Dexamethasone 8-10 mg IV** (give after IV placement; onset 10-15 min)
- [ ] **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** (apply night before or ≥2 hours pre-op for high PONV risk)
- [ ] **Midazolam 1-2 mg IV** (standard anxiolytic; does not compromise OFIA principles)
- [ ] **Avoid gabapentinoids** (gabapentin/pregabalin) — ↑ sedation, ↑ delirium, no additional benefit in multimodal pathways
- [ ] Chronic opioid patient? Continue home opioid dose morning of surgery (if prescribed)
- [ ] Hold metformin morning of surgery per institutional protocol

---

## 6. Fasting and Hydration Status

- [ ] Clear liquids allowed up to **2 hours pre-op** (water, black coffee, clear juice)
- [ ] Solids stopped per ASA fasting guidelines (6-8 hours for solid food)
- [ ] Optional **carbohydrate load**: 200-400 mL clear carb drink 2-3 hours pre-op (unless diabetic or gastroparesis)
- [ ] Assess hydration status (avoid dehydration before neuraxial anesthesia)
- [ ] IV access established with isotonic crystalloid running

---

## 7. Anesthesia Plan and Patient Counseling

- [ ] Discuss **three anesthesia pathways**:
  - [ ] Pathway 1: OFIA + ACB/IPACK (preferred for most patients)
  - [ ] Pathway 2: OFIA Block-Free (anticoagulation or block contraindications)
  - [ ] Pathway 3: Conventional Opioid-Inclusive (chronic opioid users or patient preference)
- [ ] Discuss **spinal vs general anesthesia** options if applicable
- [ ] Answer patient questions and confirm understanding
- [ ] Document **shared decision-making** conversation
- [ ] Review ERAS goals: early ambulation, reduced opioids, multimodal analgesia, faster recovery
- [ ] Confirm patient preference for **GA vs spinal** (if both appropriate)
- [ ] Document decision + rationale in preoperative note
- [ ] Explain role of midazolam for anxiolysis (standard practice)

---

## 8. Regional Anesthesia Preparation (If Applicable)

**Adductor Canal Block (ACB):**
- [ ] Ultrasound-guided with high-frequency linear probe
- [ ] Ropivacaine **0.2-0.25%**, **20-30 mL**

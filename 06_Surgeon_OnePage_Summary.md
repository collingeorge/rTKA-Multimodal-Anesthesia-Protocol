# One-Page Anesthesia Summary for Surgeons  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This one-page document summarizes the anesthesia pathways and key expectations for orthopedic surgeons performing rTKA.

**Default pathway = OFIA + ACB/IPACK unless contraindicated**

---

## 1. Primary Anesthesia Pathways

We use three standardized pathways:

1. **Pathway 1 – OFIA + ACB/IPACK (Preferred)**
   - Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia  
   - Adductor canal block + IPACK for motor-sparing analgesia  
   - Standard anxiolytic: midazolam 1–2 mg IV
   - Maintenance with sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC (or propofol TIVA)
   - Best for: opioid-naïve patients, high PONV risk, ERAS-focused cases  

2. **Pathway 2 – OFIA, Block-Free**
   - Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia without peripheral nerve blocks  
   - Standard anxiolytic: midazolam 1–2 mg IV
   - Surgeon provides periarticular local anesthetic infiltration  
   - Used when: blocks contraindicated (anticoagulation timing) or declined  

3. **Pathway 3 – Conventional Opioid-Based Anesthesia**
   - Standard general or spinal anesthesia with fentanyl/hydromorphone  
   - Standard anxiolytic: midazolam 1–2 mg IV
   - Maintenance with sevoflurane + opioid boluses
   - Reserved for: chronic opioid users, severe anxiety, or contraindications to OFIA agents

## 2. What Surgeons Should Expect (By Pathway)

### Pathway 1 – OFIA + ACB/IPACK

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Very good early analgesia (NRS 0–3/10 typical in PACU)
  - Quadriceps strength largely preserved (motor-sparing blocks)
  - Ambulation usually possible on POD 0 (4–6 hours post-op)
  - Blocks last approximately 12–18 hours

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Lower PONV and less sedation vs opioid-based techniques  
  - Patients typically alert and oriented in PACU

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - Blocks performed pre-op; adds ~10–15 min to workflow  
  - Tourniquet discomfort generally well-controlled with adjuncts (ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium)
  - Hemodynamically stable with multimodal approach

### Pathway 2 – OFIA, Block-Free

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Higher pain scores in first 12–24 hours vs ACB/IPACK (NRS 3–6/10 typical)
  - Early ambulation still achievable but may be more uncomfortable  
  - Full motor strength immediately available

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Similar PONV profile to Pathway 1 (minimal intra-op opioids)  
  - Alert and oriented in PACU

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - No block room time; fastest anesthesia workflow  
  - **Surgeon periarticular injection is critical to analgesic success**
  - Patient counseled preoperatively about higher early pain expectations

### Pathway 3 – Conventional Opioid-Based

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Variable early analgesia; may require more PACU/ward opioids  
  - Ambulation may be slower due to sedation, PONV, or hypotension  
  - If combined with blocks, pain control excellent but sedation still a factor

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Higher risk of PONV, sedation, and respiratory depression  
  - May require extended PACU monitoring
  - Increased fall risk in elderly patients

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - Familiar legacy approach; useful in select patients  
  - Does not leverage full ERAS benefits
  - Close respiratory monitoring required

## 3. What Anesthesia Needs From Surgeons

Regardless of pathway:

1. **Preoperative Communication**
   - Anticipated case duration and complexity  
   - Planned tourniquet use (pressure, estimated time)  
   - Any unusual positioning or robotic workflow issues  
   - Surgeon preference for anesthesia type (if any)

2. **Local Infiltration (Critical for Pathway 2)**
   - **Preferred infiltration recipe:** 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2% + epinephrine 5 mcg/mL ± ketorolac 30 mg
   - Document volume, concentration, and components used
   - Timing: ideally before or at closure for maximum effect
   - Infiltrate posterior capsule, periarticular tissues, and subcutaneous layers
   - Total local anesthetic dose documentation (for LAST risk assessment)

3. **Intraoperative Updates**
   - Significant blood loss or hemodynamic concerns
   - Longer than anticipated case duration
   - Any complications requiring change in postoperative plan

4. **Postoperative Expectations**
   - Target discharge timeline (same-day vs POD 1)  
   - Weight-bearing and mobilization plan (typically full weight-bearing immediate)
   - Use of drains (if any) and dressing type
   - Any concerns about patient's suitability for early discharge

## 4. Key Points for Joint Pathway Alignment

- Early mobilization, low PONV, and low opioid consumption are **shared goals**.  
- OFIA + ACB/IPACK primarily supports:
  - Faster PT engagement (typically same day)
  - Fewer side effects impairing recovery  
  - Potential reduction in LOS  
  - Lower delirium risk in elderly patients
  - Better patient satisfaction scores

- **All pathways use midazolam 1–2 mg IV** for anxiolysis—this is standard practice and does not compromise opioid-free principles

- Surgeon feedback on:
  - Pain during manipulation  
  - Tourniquet tolerance  
  - PT's experience with early mobilization  
  - Patient satisfaction
  - Discharge timing
  will inform ongoing refinement of these protocols.

## 5. Anticoagulation and Block Timing (ASRA 2024)

If planning ACB/IPACK blocks, patients must meet ASRA timing requirements:

- **DOACs:** ≥72 hours off (CrCl >50 mL/min)
- **Therapeutic LMWH:** ≥24 hours off
- **Prophylactic LMWH:** ≥12 hours off
- **Warfarin:** INR ≤1.4

If anticoagulation windows not met → **Pathway 2 (block-free)** used instead.

## 6. Quick Reference: Typical Medication Regimen

### All Pathways Include:
- Acetaminophen 1 g PO preop, then q6h
- Celecoxib 400 mg PO preop (or ketorolac 15 mg IV)
- Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV intraop
- Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (anxiolysis)
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV (antiemetic)

### OFIA Pathways Add:
- Ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic)
- Dexmedetomidine (optional, for hemodynamic stability)
- Magnesium sulfate (NMDA antagonist)
- Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC or propofol TIVA

### Conventional Pathway:
- Fentanyl or hydromorphone intraoperatively
- Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC
- Additional opioids as needed

## 8. Contact and Collaboration

For any proposed protocol changes, questions about specific cases, or project collaborations (e.g., ERAS QI initiative or prospective study), please contact the anesthesia lead for this pathway.

**Key principle:** These protocols represent evidence-based, surgeon-anesthesia collaborative care pathways designed to optimize patient outcomes while maintaining clinical flexibility for individual patient needs.

# One-Page Anesthesia Summary for Surgeons  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This one-page document summarizes the anesthesia pathways and key expectations for orthopedic surgeons performing rTKA.

**Default pathway = OFIA + ACB/IPACK unless contraindicated**

---

## 1. Primary Anesthesia Pathways

We use three standardized pathways:

1. **Pathway 1 – OFIA + ACB/IPACK (Preferred)**
   - Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia  
   - Adductor canal block + IPACK for motor-sparing analgesia  
   - Best for: opioid-naïve patients, high PONV risk, ERAS-focused cases  

2. **Pathway 2 – OFIA, Block-Free**
   - Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia without peripheral nerve blocks  
   - Surgeon provides periarticular local anesthetic infiltration  
   - Used when: blocks contraindicated (anticoagulation timing) or declined  

3. **Pathway 3 – Conventional Opioid-Based Anesthesia**
   - Standard general or spinal anesthesia with fentanyl/hydromorphone  
   - Reserved for: chronic opioid users, severe anxiety, or contraindications to OFIA agents

## 2. What Surgeons Should Expect (By Pathway)

### Pathway 1 – OFIA + ACB/IPACK

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Very good early analgesia  
  - Quadriceps strength largely preserved  
  - Ambulation usually possible on POD 0  

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Lower PONV and less sedation vs opioid-based techniques  

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - Blocks performed pre-op; adds ~10–15 min to workflow  
  - Tourniquet discomfort generally well-controlled with adjuncts  

### Pathway 2 – OFIA, Block-Free

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Higher pain scores in first 12–24 hours vs ACB/IPACK  
  - Early ambulation still achievable but may be more uncomfortable  

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Similar PONV profile to Pathway 1 (minimal intra-op opioids)  

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - No block room time; fastest anesthesia workflow  
  - Surgeon periarticular injection is critical to analgesic success  

### Pathway 3 – Conventional Opioid-Based

- **Pain / Function:**
  - Variable early analgesia; may require more PACU/ward opioids  
  - Ambulation may be slower due to sedation, PONV, or hypotension  

- **Nausea / Sedation:**
  - Higher risk of PONV, sedation, and respiratory depression  

- **Intraoperative Considerations:**
  - Familiar legacy approach; useful in select patients  
  - Does not leverage full ERAS benefits

## 3. What Anesthesia Needs From Surgeons

Regardless of pathway:

1. **Preoperative Communication**
   - Anticipated case duration and complexity  
   - Planned tourniquet use (pressure, estimated time)  
   - Any unusual positioning or robotic workflow issues  

2. **Local Infiltration (Especially Pathway 2)**
   - **Preferred infiltration recipe:** 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2 % + epinephrine 5 mcg/mL ± ketorolac 30 mg
   - Volume, concentration, and components of periarticular injection  
   - Timing relative to closure  
   - Any additives (e.g., epinephrine, ketorolac)  

4. **Postoperative Expectations**
   - Target discharge timeline (same-day vs POD 1)  
   - Weight-bearing and mobilization plan  
   - Use of drains and dressings impacting block efficacy assessment  

---

## 4. Key Points for Joint Pathway Alignment

- Early mobilization, low PONV, and low opioid consumption are **shared goals**.  
- OFIA + ACB/IPACK primarily supports:
  - Faster PT engagement  
  - Fewer side effects impairing recovery  
  - Potential reduction in LOS  

- Surgeon feedback on:
  - Pain during manipulation  
  - Tourniquet tolerance  
  - PT’s experience with early mobilization  
  will inform ongoing refinement of these protocols.

# One-Page Anesthesia Summary for Surgeons  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

A concise reference for orthopedic surgeons outlining anesthesia pathways, expected postoperative trajectories, and shared decision-making considerations for streamlined rTKA workflow.

**Default Pathway → OFIA + ACB/IPACK unless contraindicated.**

# 1. Anesthesia Pathways Used in rTKA

We employ three standardized pathways to maintain consistency and predictable outcomes:

---

## Pathway 1 — OFIA + ACB/IPACK (Preferred ERAS Pathway)

- Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia  
- **Adductor canal block + IPACK** (motor-sparing, high analgesic value)  
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** preoperatively (standard anxiolysis)  
- Maintenance: **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** or **Propofol TIVA**  
- Ideal for: opioid-naïve patients, high PONV risk, ERAS/ambulation-first recovery models  

---

## Pathway 2 — OFIA, Block-Free

- No peripheral nerve blocks (contraindication, refusal, or workflow needs)  
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration becomes the primary analgesic driver**  
- Same anesthetic profile as Pathway 1 otherwise  
- Expected higher early pain scores, but maintained motor preservation  

---

## Pathway 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

- Standard general or spinal anesthesia with fentanyl or hydromorphone  
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** remains standard  
- Higher sedation/PONV risk  
- Reserved for: chronic opioid users, severe preoperative anxiety, contraindications to OFIA agents  

---

# 2. What Surgeons Should Expect (Pathway-by-Pathway)

---

## Pathway 1 — OFIA + ACB/IPACK

**Analgesia & Function**  
- NRS 0–3/10 typical in PACU  
- Excellent early ambulation (POD 0, usually 4–6 hours postop)  
- Block duration: **12–18 hours**  
- Quadriceps strength preserved (motor-sparing)

**Nausea / Sedation**  
- Very low PONV  
- Patients are alert, oriented, and mobilization-ready

**Intraoperative Notes**  
- Adds ~10–15 minutes for block placement  
- Tourniquet discomfort well controlled with ketamine/dexmedetomidine/magnesium adjuncts  
- Smooth hemodynamics expected  

---

## Pathway 2 — OFIA, Block-Free

**Analgesia & Function**  
- Moderate early pain (NRS 3–6/10)  
- Expect more movement-related discomfort  
- Motor strength fully intact for early mobilization  

**Nausea / Sedation**  
- Minimal PONV since opioids are avoided  

**Intraoperative Notes**  
- Fastest workflow — no block room delay  
- **Quality of periarticular infiltration significantly influences success**  

---

## Pathway 3 — Conventional Opioid-Based

**Analgesia & Function**  
- Variable early pain  
- Higher opioid requirements in PACU  
- Potential delayed ambulation due to sedation or PONV  

**Nausea / Sedation**  
- Elevated PONV and respiratory-depression risk  
- Elderly may experience increased delirium or delayed recovery  

**Intraoperative Notes**  
- Familiar technique but not fully aligned with ERAS goals  
- Enhanced monitoring required  

---

# 3. What Anesthesia Needs From Surgeons

---

## Preoperative Communication
- Expected case duration  
- Tourniquet pressure/time  
- Positioning or robotic setup issues  
- Surgeon preference for spinal vs GA (if any)

---

## Local Infiltration (Critical for Pathway 2)

**Preferred recipe:**  
- **100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2% + epinephrine 5 mcg/mL ± ketorolac 30 mg**

**Technique expectations:**  
- Adequate posterior capsule, periarticular, and subcutaneous coverage  
- Document volumes and components for LAST risk assessment  
- Ideal timing: before closure

---

## Intraoperative Updates
- Significant blood loss or instability  
- Prolonged surgical time  
- Changes in postoperative plan  

---

## Postoperative Expectations
- Full weight-bearing unless specified  
- Goal POD 0 ambulation (Pathways 1 and 2)  
- Dressing type, drains, or restrictions should be clarified  
- Early PT coordination  

---

# 4. Shared Pathway Alignment

- All pathways use standardized multimodal therapy  
- Shared goals:
  - Early mobilization  
  - Low PONV  
  - Minimized opioid exposure  
  - Patient satisfaction and consistent outcomes  

**Key principle:**  
**Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** is universal anxiolysis and remains compatible with OFIA principles.

Surgeon feedback on pain during manipulation, tourniquet tolerance, and early PT response directly informs protocol refinements.

---

# 5. Anticoagulation & Block Timing (ASRA 2024–2025)

**If ACB/IPACK desired, patients must meet ASRA timing windows:**

- **DOACs:** ≥72 h (CrCl >50 mL/min)  
- **Therapeutic LMWH:** ≥24 h  
- **Prophylactic LMWH:** ≥12 h  
- **Warfarin:** INR ≤1.4  

If not met → default to **Pathway 2 (Block-Free)**.

---

# 6. Quick Medication Snapshot

### All Pathways
- Acetaminophen 1 g  
- NSAID (celecoxib 400 mg or ketorolac 15 mg IV)  
- Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV  
- Midazolam 1–2 mg IV  
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV  

### OFIA Pathways
- Ketamine (induction + low-dose infusion)  
- Dexmedetomidine  
- Magnesium  
- Sevoflurane or propofol TIVA  

### Conventional Pathway
- Fentanyl or hydromorphone intraoperatively

# One-Page Anesthesia Summary for Surgeons  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

A concise surgeon-facing reference outlining anesthesia pathways, expected postoperative trajectories, and key coordination points for streamlined rTKA workflow.

**Default pathway → Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) unless contraindicated.**

# 1. Anesthesia Pathways Used in rTKA

We use three standardized pathways to maintain consistency and predictable perioperative trajectories:

---

## Protocol 1 — OFIA + ACB/IPACK (Preferred ERAS Pathway)
- Opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (opioid rescue remains available postoperatively as clinically indicated)  
- **Adductor canal block + IPACK** (motor-sparing, high analgesic value)  
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** preoperatively (standard anxiolysis)  
- Maintenance: **sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** or **propofol TIVA**  
- Best fit: opioid-naïve patients, high PONV risk, ERAS/ambulation-first recovery models  

## Protocol 2 — OFIA, Block-Free
- No peripheral nerve blocks (contraindication, refusal, or workflow constraints)  
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration is the primary local analgesic driver**  
- Same OFIA pharmacologic backbone as Protocol 1  
- Expect higher early pain scores vs Protocol 1, with preserved motor function  

## Protocol 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive
- General anesthesia with intraoperative fentanyl or hydromorphone (as indicated)  
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** remains standard anxiolysis  
- Higher sedation/PONV/respiratory-risk profile  
- Best fit: chronic opioid users, severe preoperative anxiety, contraindications to OFIA adjuncts, or attending preference

# 2. What Surgeons Should Expect (Pathway-by-Pathway)

## Protocol 1 — OFIA + ACB/IPACK
**Analgesia & function**  
- PACU pain often **NRS 0–3/10**  
- Early ambulation commonly feasible **POD 0** (often 4–6 h postop depending on PT workflow)  
- Block duration: **12–18 h** typical  
- Quadriceps strength preserved (motor-sparing profile)

**Nausea / sedation**  
- Lower PONV and grogginess vs opioid-inclusive techniques  
- Patients typically alert and mobilization-ready earlier

**Workflow notes**  
- Adds ~10–15 min for block placement (block room can neutralize delay)  
- Tourniquet discomfort mitigated with OFIA adjuncts  
- Hemodynamics generally smooth; bradycardia/hypotension possible with dexmedetomidine

## Protocol 2 — OFIA, Block-Free
**Analgesia & function**  
- Early pain often **NRS 3–6/10** (especially with movement)  
- Motor strength intact; mobilization remains feasible

**Nausea / sedation**  
- PONV generally reduced due to opioid avoidance (still risk-stratified)

**Workflow notes**  
- Fastest workflow (no block setup)  
- **Quality and distribution of periarticular infiltration materially determines success**

## Protocol 3 — Conventional Opioid-Inclusive
**Analgesia & function**  
- Variable early pain; higher PACU opioid rescue may be required  
- Ambulation may be delayed by sedation and/or PONV

**Nausea / sedation**  
- Higher PONV and respiratory-depression risk  
- Elderly/frail patients at increased delirium/fall risk

**Workflow notes**  
- Familiar technique but less ERAS-aligned  
- May require enhanced postoperative monitoring depending on opioid exposure and comorbidities

# 3. What Anesthesia Needs From Surgeons

## Preoperative communication
- Expected case duration  
- Tourniquet pressure/time  
- Positioning/robotic setup considerations that may limit airway access or delay turnover  
- Preference for spinal vs GA (if any) and anticipated tolerance of sedation level  

## Periarticular infiltration (critical for Protocol 2)
**Example recipe (institution-specific—confirm local formulary/policy):**  
- **100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2% + epinephrine 5 mcg/mL ± ketorolac 30 mg**

**Technique expectations**  
- Posterior capsule + periarticular + subcutaneous coverage as appropriate  
- Document volume and components (LAST risk assessment and continuity of care)  
- Preferred timing: prior to closure

## Intraoperative updates
- Unexpected blood loss/instability  
- Prolonged surgical time  
- Change in postoperative plan (WB status, drains, unexpected restrictions)

## Postoperative expectations
- Clarify WB status and restrictions  
- PT and discharge pathway (same-day vs POD 1)  
- Dressing type/drains/brace instructions communicated early to PACU/floor  

---

# 4. Shared Goals Across All Pathways
- Early mobilization and functional recovery  
- Low PONV and clear emergence when feasible  
- Minimized opioid exposure with safe rescue options  
- Predictable PACU course and standardized communication  

**Key principle:** **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** is standard anxiolysis and remains compatible with OFIA principles.

---

# 5. Anticoagulation & Block Timing (ASRA 2024–2025)
If ACB/IPACK is desired, patient must meet ASRA timing windows (deep peripheral block approach):

- **DOACs:** ≥72 h (CrCl >50 mL/min); longer holds with reduced renal function per ASRA  
- **Therapeutic LMWH:** ≥24 h  
- **Prophylactic LMWH:** ≥12 h  
- **Warfarin:** INR ≤1.4  

If not met → default to **Protocol 2 (Block-Free)** or **Protocol 3** as clinically indicated.

---

# 6. Quick Medication Snapshot (High-Level)

### All pathways (typical ERAS baseline)
- Acetaminophen  
- NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor (one strategy)  
- Dexamethasone  
- Midazolam  
- Ondansetron  

### OFIA pathways (Protocols 1–2)
- Ketamine (induction + low-dose infusion)  
- Dexmedetomidine  
- Magnesium  
- Sevoflurane or propofol TIVA  

### Conventional pathway (Protocol 3)
- Intraoperative opioid (fentanyl or hydromorphone) as indicated

# 8. Collaboration & Feedback
Surgeon feedback on tourniquet tolerance, intraoperative manipulation pain, infiltration performance, and early PT response is used to iteratively refine protocol targets while preserving attending-level discretion.

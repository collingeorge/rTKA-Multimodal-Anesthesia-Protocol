# Adjuncts, Contraindications, and Safety Considerations  
Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA) – 2025 Update

This document summarizes safety considerations, contraindications, and monitoring requirements for adjunct medications and regional anesthesia used within the rTKA multimodal pathways. Content reflects ERAS Society guidance (2019–2025), ASA/APSF safety statements (2023–2025), and ASRA 2024–2025 anticoagulation guidelines.

## 1. Opioid-Free Adjuncts – Absolute & Relative Contraindications

| Agent | Absolute Contraindications | Relative / Use With Caution | Monitoring & Notes |
|-------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Midazolam** | Known benzodiazepine allergy | Severe respiratory disease, myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea (use lower doses 1 mg), advanced age >80 | Standard anxiolytic; does not compromise OFIA principles; typical dose 1–2 mg IV |
| **Ketamine** | Acute psychosis; uncontrolled schizophrenia | Uncontrolled HTN (SBP >180), severe CAD, recent CVA/TIA, history of severe PTSD flashbacks | Avoid induction doses >0.5 mg/kg in CAD; sub-anesthetic infusions have very low psychomimetic risk |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-degree AV block (2°/3° without pacemaker); HR <45 despite anticholinergic | Baseline HR <55, hypovolemia, severe LV dysfunction, age >70 | Stop infusion if HR <50 with symptoms; glycopyrrolate > atropine for treatment; hypotension possible in frail patients |
| **Magnesium sulfate** | Myasthenia gravis; complete heart block; CrCl <30 mL/min | CrCl 30–50 mL/min (reduce dose 25–50%) | Infuse over ≥15–20 minutes; monitor reflexes if overdose suspected; enhances NMBD effects |
| **Lidocaine infusion** (block-free pathway) | Severe hepatic impairment; amide local anesthetic allergy | Heart block, CHF, weight <50 kg, baseline QT prolongation | Max 2 mg/kg/hr; keep total dose <300 mg; lipid rescue available for LAST |
| **Sevoflurane** | Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility; known volatile anesthetic hypersensitivity | Severe intracranial hypertension, neuromuscular disease (prolonged emergence possible) | Preferred volatile agent for OFIA and conventional pathways; easily titratable with favorable recovery profile |

## 2. Regional Anesthesia – ACB + IPACK Contraindications

| Absolute | Relative (Shared Decision-Making) |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Patient refusal | Local skin infection |
| Active systemic infection / sepsis | Chronic pain on high-dose opioids |
| Coagulopathy outside ASRA 2024 windows | Baseline sensory or motor deficits in operative limb |
| Allergy to amide local anesthetics | Severe spinal deformity (if spinal also considered) |

### **ASRA 2024 Timing Reference**  
Applicable for deep peripheral blocks (IPACK):

- **DOACs (rivaroxaban / apixaban / edoxaban):** ≥72 h (CrCl >50) / ≥120 h (CrCl <50)  
- **Dabigatran:** 72–120 h depending on renal function  
- **Warfarin:** INR ≤1.4  
- **Therapeutic LMWH:** ≥24 h  
- **Prophylactic LMWH:** ≥12 h  

**Local anesthetic safety:**  
Total volume for ACB + IPACK (~40–50 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%) requires readiness for **LAST management**.

---

## 3. Opioid-Inclusive Pathway – Relative Contraindications

These favor choosing OFIA + ACB/IPACK instead.

- Severe or untreated OSA (STOP-Bang ≥5 + witnessed apneas)  
- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome  
- COPD or chronic respiratory disease requiring home O₂  
- History of post-op respiratory failure or prolonged ventilation  
- Neuromuscular disease (impaired cough/glottic closure)  
- Frail elderly with high delirium risk

## 4. Agents to Avoid Routinely in rTKA (2024–2025 Consensus)

| Agent | Reason (Evidence Level) | Key References |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin)** | Increase dizziness, delirium, respiratory suppression; provide no additional opioid-sparing benefit in modern multimodal pathways | Angst 2024; Memtsoudis 2023; ASA/APSF 2024 |
| **Routine intraoperative opioids in opioid-naïve patients** | Higher PONV, respiratory depression, ileus, delayed mobilization | Soffin 2023; ERAS 2024 |
| **High-dose dexamethasone (>10 mg)** | No added analgesic benefit; unnecessary hyperglycemia risk | De Oliveira 2022; Li 2024 |

## 5. Dose Adjustments for Special Populations

### Frail / Older Adults (>70 years)
- Midazolam: reduce to **1 mg** or avoid if severe frailty
- Ketamine induction: max **0.3 mg/kg**
- Dex infusion: **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr**
- Magnesium: lower end of **30 mg/kg**
- Consider reducing volatile agent concentration to minimize delirium risk

### Cardiac Disease (CAD, HFrEF)
- Avoid rapid bolus of dexmedetomidine  
- Avoid tachycardia-triggering ketamine doses >0.3 mg/kg  
- Maintain MAP >65, slow titration
- Sevoflurane well-tolerated in cardiac patients when titrated appropriately

### Renal Impairment
- Reduce magnesium dose by 25–50% for CrCl 30–50 mL/min  
- Avoid MgSO₄ if CrCl <30 mL/min  
- No dose adjustment needed for midazolam or sevoflurane

---

## 6. Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) Preparedness
- Keep lipid emulsion immediately available  
- Max ropivacaine recommended doses should be respected  
- Early signs: perioral numbness, tinnitus, agitation, metallic taste  
- Advanced: seizures, arrhythmias  
- Treat with 20% lipid emulsion per ASRA LAST guidelines

---

## 7. Clinical Pearls
- **Midazolam** is standard practice for anxiolysis and does not interfere with OFIA principles
- **Sevoflurane** is preferred by many practitioners for its ease of titration and favorable recovery profile
- All protocols should maintain flexibility based on patient-specific factors and practitioner preference
- Regional blocks remain the gold standard for rTKA analgesia when not contraindicated

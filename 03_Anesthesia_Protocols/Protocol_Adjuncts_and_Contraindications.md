## 1. Standard Agents & Opioid-Free Adjuncts – Absolute & Relative Contraindications

| Agent | Absolute Contraindications | Relative / Use With Caution | Monitoring & Notes |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Midazolam** | Known benzodiazepine allergy; acute narrow-angle glaucoma | Severe respiratory disease, myasthenia gravis, OSA (use lowest effective dose), advanced age >80, severe hepatic impairment, baseline cognitive impairment/delirium phenotype | Standard anxiolytic across pathways; compatible with OFIA. Typical **1–2 mg IV**; consider **0.5–1 mg** in elderly/OSA/frail. Onset 1–3 min; duration ~30–60 min. Avoid repeat dosing if adequate anxiolysis already achieved. |
| **Propofol** | True propofol hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis | Hemodynamic instability, severe cardiac dysfunction, hypovolemia, severe hypotension | **UNIVERSAL INDUCTION AGENT** in repository: **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (consider **1–1.5 mg/kg** in frail/cardiac). **TIVA maintenance:** **75–150 mcg/kg/min**. Causes dose-dependent hypotension/respiratory depression; ensure vasopressors available; consider dedicated IV line for infusion. |
| **Sevoflurane** | Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility; known volatile anesthetic hypersensitivity | Severe intracranial hypertension, select neuromuscular disorders (emergence considerations) | **COMMON MAINTENANCE OPTION:** **0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)**. May be used as primary volatile or as additive/hybrid with propofol depending on workflow. Agent analyzer required; titrate to physiology and depth targets. |
| **Ketamine** | Acute psychosis/active schizophrenia with psychosis; severe uncontrolled hypertension (e.g., SBP >180) | CAD/ischemia risk, significant tachyarrhythmia risk, catecholamine-depleted physiology with shock, frailty/advanced age, severe PTSD flashbacks (context-dependent), elevated ICP (context-dependent), acute globe injury | OFIA adjunct at sub-anesthetic doses. Typical bolus **0.2–0.5 mg/kg**; infusion **0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr**. Favor lower dosing or omit in frail/hemodynamically fragile. **BIS/EEG caveat:** ketamine can increase BIS and alter EEG indices; avoid titrating hypnotic to BIS alone. |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-degree AV block (2°/3° without pacemaker); severe baseline bradycardia refractory to therapy | Baseline HR <55, hypovolemia, severe LV dysfunction (EF <30%), age >70, beta-blockers, conduction disease | Prefer infusion without routine bolus. Typical infusion **0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr** (elderly/frail: **0.2–0.4**). If symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension: reduce/stop infusion; consider **glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** per clinician judgment and local policy. Avoid rapid/high bolus dosing. |
| **Magnesium sulfate** | Myasthenia gravis; complete heart block; severe renal impairment (CrCl <30) | CrCl 30–50 (reduce 25–50%), baseline hypotension, digitalis therapy (toxicity risk) | Typical **30–50 mg/kg** over ≥15–20 min (40 mg/kg ≈ 3 g for 70 kg). Infuse slowly to avoid hypotension. Potentiates NMBD effect—monitor TOF and anticipate prolonged blockade. |
| **Lidocaine infusion** (systemic; OFIA adjunct) | Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), amide local anesthetic allergy, complete heart block without pacing | Conduction disease/ventricular arrhythmia risk, CHF with low EF, very low body weight, significant drug interactions, severe renal impairment (institution-dependent) | If used: **1–2 mg/kg/hr** per institutional protocol; consider conservative total-dose caps and monitoring for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste, confusion). Ensure **20% lipid emulsion** immediately available. |

## 2. Regional Anesthesia – ACB + IPACK Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Rationale | Clinical Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Patient refusal** | Autonomy and informed consent | Document counseling and refusal; offer alternatives (OFIA block-free or conventional). |
| **Active systemic infection / sepsis** | Risk of seeding deep tissues | Defer blocks until infection treated; consider surgeon periarticular infiltration. |
| **Coagulopathy / anticoagulation outside safe window** | Bleeding risk for deep peripheral blocks | Use current institutional table aligned with **ASRA/ESRA**; document last dose timing + renal function when relevant. |
| **Allergy to amide local anesthetics** | Anaphylaxis risk | Ropivacaine/bupivacaine/lidocaine are amides; avoid. |

### Relative Contraindications (Shared Decision-Making)

| Contraindication | Considerations | Management Strategy |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Local infection at injection site** | Infection propagation risk | Defer blocks or choose alternative. |
| **Baseline neuro deficits in operative limb** | Difficult to assess new deficits | Document baseline neuro exam; consider risk/benefit. |
| **Prior peripheral nerve injury** | Potential exacerbation/medicolegal risk | Detailed consent; baseline documentation; consider alternate pathway. |
| **Anatomical difficulty** | Obesity/edema/prior surgery | Use experienced operator; ensure backup plan. |
| **High opioid tolerance** | May blunt subjective benefit | Blocks still reduce periop opioid escalation; set expectations. |

### ASRA/ESRA 2024–2025 Anticoagulation Timing Reference (Deep Peripheral Block Approach)

> **Reminder:** Timing is agent-, dose-, renal-function-, and procedure-dependent. Always follow **current ASRA/ESRA guidance + institutional policy**.

| Anticoagulant | Typical Preop Hold (Illustrative) | Typical Restart (Illustrative) | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **DOACs** (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) | ≥72 h (CrCl >50)<br>≥120 h (CrCl <50) | Per institutional policy | Verify last dose timing and renal function. |
| **Dabigatran** | 72–120 h (renal-function dependent) | Per institutional policy | Longer holds with reduced CrCl. |
| **Warfarin** | INR target per institutional policy (often ≤1.4 for deep blocks) | Per surgical/team plan | Verify day-of INR. |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24 h | Per institutional policy | Higher bleed-risk profile. |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥12 h | Per institutional policy | Common VTE prophylaxis dosing. |
| **Aspirin** | Often no hold | Continue | Commonly permitted for peripheral blocks per ASRA/ESRA. |
| **Clopidogrel** | Institutional variability | Institutional variability | Even when guidance is permissive, many institutions require a 5–7 day hold; **local policy supersedes**. |
| **NSAIDs** | Often no hold | Continue | Generally permitted for peripheral blocks. |

### Local Anesthetic Safety – ACB + IPACK (Ropivacaine Example)

**Typical dosing (illustrative):**
- **ACB:** 20–30 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25% (40–75 mg)
- **IPACK:** 15–20 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25% (30–50 mg)
- **Total:** commonly ~70–125 mg (patient- and technique-dependent)

**Safety framing:**
- Common conservative reference for ropivacaine plain: **~3 mg/kg** (institution-dependent).  
- Document cumulative local anesthetic totals including surgeon infiltration (LIA) to support LAST risk assessment.

**LAST preparedness:**
- **20% lipid emulsion must be immediately available** in block area and OR.
- Treatment pathway visible; roles assigned in event of toxicity.

## 3. Opioid-Inclusive Pathway – Relative Contraindications

The following factors strongly favor OFIA-based pathways (with or without blocks) over conventional opioid-heavy approaches:

### Respiratory Concerns (High Priority)
- Severe or untreated OSA (high STOP-Bang phenotype; severe AHI when known)
- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- COPD with hypercapnia or home O₂
- Prior post-op respiratory failure or prolonged ventilation
- Neuromuscular disease with weak cough/airway protection

### Cognitive/Delirium Risk
- Frail elderly (especially >80)
- Baseline cognitive impairment or prior post-op delirium
- Polypharmacy with sedatives

### PONV / Recovery Concerns
- Severe prior PONV with opioid exposure
- Prior prolonged ileus/constipation
- Patient preference for clear-headed recovery and early mobilization

**Clinical pearl:** Even for chronic opioid users, consider OFIA + blocks as first-line when feasible. Continue baseline opioids but avoid intraoperative opioid escalation.

---

## 4. Agents to Avoid Routinely in rTKA (2024–2025 Consensus)

| Agent | Rationale | Safer Alternatives |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Gabapentinoids** (routine use) | Sedation, dizziness, delirium, respiratory risk signals in high-risk phenotypes with minimal incremental benefit in modern multimodal pathways | ERAS-aligned multimodal (acetaminophen + NSAID if safe + dexamethasone + regional techniques when feasible) |
| **Routine high intraoperative opioids in opioid-naïve** | Higher PONV, sedation, ileus, respiratory depression risk (OSA/elderly); may delay mobilization | OFIA pathways; use opioids as rescue when needed |
| **High-dose dexamethasone (>10 mg routinely)** | Hyperglycemia risk without clear additional benefit beyond 8–10 mg in most pathways | Dexamethasone **8–10 mg IV** per phenotype |
| **Rapid/large dexmedetomidine bolus loading** | Increased bradycardia/hypotension; minimal benefit vs slow titration | Infusion-first strategy; optional slow loading only in selected patients |
| **Droperidol (routine prophylaxis)** | QT concerns and monitoring requirements; institutional variability | Ondansetron + dexamethasone ± scopolamine based on PONV phenotype |

---

## 5. Dose Adjustments for Special Populations

### 5.1 Frail / Older Adults (>70, frailty phenotype)

| Agent | Standard Adult | Frail/Elderly Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Midazolam** | 1–2 mg | Consider ≤1 mg or avoid in high delirium phenotype | Prolonged sedation/delirium risk |
| **Propofol induction** | 1.5–2 mg/kg | 1–1.5 mg/kg, slow titration | Hypotension sensitivity |
| **Ketamine bolus** | 0.2–0.5 mg/kg | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg or omit | Minimize psychomimetic/prolonged recovery risk |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr; avoid bolus | Bradycardia/hypotension risk |
| **Magnesium** | 30–50 mg/kg | Favor ~30 mg/kg or omit if concerns | Reduced clearance/reserve |
| **Sevoflurane** | 0.8–1.2 MAC | Lower age-adjusted MAC targets; consider processed EEG | Delirium risk mitigation |
| **Opioids (if used)** | Hydromorphone 0.2 mg | Start 0.1 mg with longer reassessment intervals | Respiratory depression risk |

Additional considerations:
- Favor regional techniques to reduce systemic sedatives/opioids
- Enhanced monitoring in PACU and early floor period
- Delirium-prevention bundle (reorientation, sleep hygiene, early mobilization)

---

### 5.2 Cardiac Disease (CAD/HFrEF/arrhythmias/valvular disease)

Key strategies:
- Slow induction; avoid abrupt afterload drops
- Maintain coronary perfusion (MAP targets individualized)
- Minimize tachycardia; treat hypotension with appropriate vasopressors

Practical notes:
- Consider etomidate for severe dysfunction if propofol intolerance anticipated
- Limit ketamine to low adjunct dosing or omit if tachyarrhythmia/ischemia risk
- Dexmedetomidine cautiously (bradycardia/hypotension); infusion-first

---

### 5.3 Renal Impairment

| Agent | CrCl >50 | CrCl 30–50 | CrCl <30 | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Magnesium** | Standard | Reduce 25–50% | Avoid | Renal clearance/toxicity risk |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | Standard | Consider lower | Consider 25–50% reduction | Clearance reduced in severe disease |
| **Rocuronium** | Standard | Standard | Extend interval; TOF-guided | Prolonged effect possible |
| **NSAIDs** | Per phenotype | Use caution | Avoid | Renal/GI/CV risk |
| **Sugammadex** | Institutional practice | Institutional practice | Institutional practice | Follow local guidance for severe renal failure |

---

### 5.4 Hepatic Impairment

Key strategies:
- Reduce sedatives (midazolam especially) in moderate/severe disease
- Avoid systemic lidocaine infusion in severe hepatic impairment

Acetaminophen max daily dose should be reduced per phenotype and local policy.

---

### 5.5 OSA / Obesity

Core principles:
- Prefer OFIA + regional techniques when feasible
- Minimize sedatives and opioids
- Enhanced monitoring (continuous pulse oximetry; consider capnography in high-risk phenotypes)
- Ensure CPAP/BiPAP plan if home user

Weight-based dosing reminders:
- Propofol induction often titrated to effect; avoid overdosing (consider lean/ideal weight frameworks per local practice)
- Sugammadex dosing per manufacturer labeling and institutional policy

---

## 6. Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS) - Rare but Serious

**Definition:** Rare complication of prolonged high-dose propofol associated with metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and cardiac failure.

**Risk context:**
- Typically associated with **prolonged infusions (>48 hours)** and high doses (**>5 mg/kg/hr**, i.e., **~83 mcg/kg/min**).
- **Not expected** in routine rTKA cases (typical duration 1–3 hours), but included for completeness.

**If suspected:**
- Stop propofol, switch sedation strategy, provide supportive care, escalate to ICU-level management.

---

## 7. Propofol Allergy – Alternative Induction Strategies

**True propofol hypersensitivity is rare.** Many charted "allergies" reflect injection pain or hypotension rather than immune-mediated allergy.

### 7.1 Egg/Soy Allergy Clarification (High-Precision Framing)

Propofol emulsion contains **purified egg lecithin (phosphatidylcholine)** and **highly refined soybean oil**, which generally **do not contain allergenic egg/soy proteins**. Most patients with egg/soy allergy can receive propofol; however, those with severe anaphylaxis histories require individualized risk assessment and may warrant avoidance per institutional practice.

### 7.2 Alternative Induction Agents (Illustrative)

| Agent | Dose | Advantages | Disadvantages | Use Case |
|-------|------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Etomidate** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg | Hemodynamic stability; rapid onset | Myoclonus; adrenal suppression considerations | Severe cardiac disease or propofol avoidance |
| **Ketamine** (sole induction agent) | 1–2 mg/kg | Bronchodilation; maintains BP | Tachycardia/HTN; emergence phenomena | Selected cases (e.g., bronchospasm risk) |
| **Sevoflurane** inhaled induction | 6–8% | Avoids IV induction agent | Slower, airway irritation | Rare adult use; selected circumstances |

**Preferred alternative in many adult rTKA contexts:** **Etomidate-based** induction when propofol contraindicated.

---

## 8. Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) Preparedness

LAST is rare but potentially fatal; preparedness is mandatory for regional anesthesia and high-volume periarticular infiltration.

### 8.1 Prevention

- Calculate and document cumulative local anesthetic totals (blocks + infiltration)
- Use ultrasound guidance, incremental injection, frequent aspiration
- Maintain continuous monitoring during and after injection
- Ensure **20% lipid emulsion** is immediately available

### 8.2 Recognition (CNS usually first)

Early: perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, agitation  
Progression: seizures  
Late: hypotension, arrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse

### 8.3 Treatment (High-Level)

- Stop injection; call for help
- Airway/oxygenation/ventilation
- Seizure control with benzodiazepines
- **20% lipid emulsion therapy**
- Modified ACLS dosing strategies per institutional LAST protocol
- ICU monitoring after event

### 8.4 LAST Treatment Checklist (Post in Block Area)
```

☐ STOP local anesthetic injection
☐ Call for help - announce “LAST protocol”
☐ 100% oxygen, airway management
☐ LIPID EMULSION 20%:
☐ Bolus: 1.5 mL/kg over 1 min
☐ Infusion: 0.25 mL/kg/min
☐ Manage seizures: benzodiazepines (avoid large propofol doses in unstable patients)
☐ Cardiovascular support with small-dose vasopressors per protocol
☐ If arrest: ACLS modifications + continue lipid + consider ECMO if available
☐ ICU admission for monitoring

```
### 8.5 Prevention Checklist (Before Every Block)
```

☐ Lipid emulsion 20% immediately available (location + expiration verified)
☐ Resuscitation equipment ready (oxygen, airway, suction, defibrillator)
☐ Maximum safe dose estimated for patient weight + cumulative plan
☐ Incremental injection with frequent aspiration
☐ Patient monitored throughout + post-block observation
☐ Total local anesthetic dose documented (blocks + infiltration)

```

## 9. Clinical Pearls

### 9.1 Standard Agents (Used Across Pathways)

- **Midazolam:** anxiolysis/amnesia; dose-reduce in elderly/OSA; avoid repeat dosing if already effective.
- **Propofol:** universal induction agent; hypotension risk—titrate slowly; vasopressors ready.
- **Sevoflurane:** common maintenance agent; can be primary or additive/hybrid based on workflow.

### 9.2 Maintenance Choice After Propofol Induction

**Propofol TIVA favored for:**
- High PONV phenotype
- MH susceptibility/volatile avoidance preference
- Institutional workflow or clinician preference

**Sevoflurane favored for:**
- Common workflow and ease of titration
- Familiarity and rapid titratability
- Hybrid strategies or longer cases

Both are acceptable; selection is phenotype- and workflow-dependent.

### 9.3 OFIA Adjuncts

- **Ketamine:** sub-anesthetic dosing for analgesia/antihyperalgesia; use guardrails in frail/hemodynamically fragile.
- **Dexmedetomidine:** infusion-first; bradycardia/hypotension monitoring; stop/reduce early before emergence.
- **Magnesium:** NMDA modulation; infuse slowly; avoid in severe renal impairment; potentiates NMBD.
- **Lidocaine infusion:** institutional protocol only; avoid in severe hepatic impairment and significant conduction disease; monitor for CNS toxicity.

### 9.4 Regional Analgesia

- **ACB + IPACK** provides circumferential knee analgesia with motor-sparing intent.
- If blocks are not performed, surgeon periarticular infiltration becomes critical; expect higher early pain and rescue needs.

### 9.5 Safety Priorities

- **LAST preparedness** is mandatory whenever blocks or high-volume infiltration are used.
- Opioid-based pathways require conservative dosing and enhanced monitoring in OSA/elderly/frail.

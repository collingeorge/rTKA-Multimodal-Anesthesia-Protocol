## 1. Standard Agents & Opioid-Free Adjuncts – Absolute & Relative Contraindications

| Agent | Absolute Contraindications | Relative / Use With Caution | Monitoring & Notes |
|-------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Midazolam** | Known benzodiazepine allergy; acute narrow-angle glaucoma | Severe respiratory disease, myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea (use lower doses 1 mg), advanced age >80, severe hepatic impairment | Standard preoperative anxiolytic across all pathways; does not compromise OFIA principles; typical dose 1–2 mg IV preop; onset 1-3 min, duration 30-60 min |
| **Propofol** | Allergy to propofol, eggs, or soy products | Hemodynamic instability, severe cardiac dysfunction, hypovolemia, severe hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) | **UNIVERSAL INDUCTION AGENT:** 1.5-2 mg/kg IV for all three pathways at UW and most institutions; **TIVA maintenance:** 75-150 mcg/kg/min (alternative to sevoflurane); causes dose-dependent hypotension and respiratory depression; dedicated IV line recommended for infusion |
| **Sevoflurane** | Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility; known volatile anesthetic hypersensitivity; personal or family history of MH | Severe intracranial hypertension, neuromuscular disease (prolonged emergence possible) | **PRIMARY MAINTENANCE OPTION:** 0.8-1.2 MAC for all pathways (alternative to propofol TIVA); easily titratable with favorable recovery profile; well-tolerated in cardiac patients; preferred by many practitioners at UW |
| **Ketamine** | Acute psychosis; uncontrolled schizophrenia; severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg) | Uncontrolled HTN (SBP 160-180), severe CAD, recent CVA/TIA (<3 months), history of severe PTSD flashbacks, increased ICP, acute globe injury | Avoid induction doses >0.5 mg/kg in CAD; sub-anesthetic infusions (0.1-0.25 mg/kg/hr) have very low psychomimetic risk; may cause transient hypertension and tachycardia; dissociative effects rare at analgesic doses |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-degree AV block (2°/3° without pacemaker); HR <45 despite anticholinergic; severe bradycardia (<40 bpm) | Baseline HR <55, hypovolemia, severe LV dysfunction (EF <30%), age >70, beta-blocker therapy | Stop infusion if HR <50 with symptoms (hypotension, dizziness, chest discomfort); glycopyrrolate 0.2-0.4 mg IV > atropine for bradycardia treatment (longer duration, less tachycardia); hypotension possible in frail patients; avoid large bolus doses (>1 mcg/kg) |
| **Magnesium sulfate** | Myasthenia gravis; complete heart block; severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) | CrCl 30–50 mL/min (reduce dose 25–50%); digitalis therapy (potentiates toxicity); baseline hypotension | Infuse over ≥15–20 minutes to avoid hypotension; monitor deep tendon reflexes if overdose suspected (loss of reflexes = early toxicity); enhances NMBD effects (may prolong blockade by 15-25%); typical dose 30-50 mg/kg (40 mg/kg = ~3 g for 70 kg patient) |
| **Lidocaine infusion** (block-free pathway) | Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C); amide local anesthetic allergy; complete heart block; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; Adams-Stokes syndrome | Heart block (1° or 2°), CHF (EF <30%), weight <50 kg, baseline QT prolongation (QTc >500 ms), severe renal disease (CrCl <30) | Max 2 mg/kg/hr during surgery; keep total intraoperative dose <300 mg; lipid rescue available for LAST; monitor for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste, confusion, slurred speech); discontinue if signs of toxicity |

## 2. Regional Anesthesia – ACB + IPACK Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Rationale | Clinical Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Patient refusal** | Autonomy, informed consent | Document counseling and refusal clearly; offer alternative pathways (OFIA block-free or conventional) |
| **Active systemic infection / sepsis** | Risk of seeding infection to deep tissues | Defer blocks until infection treated; consider surgeon periarticular infiltration |
| **Coagulopathy outside ASRA 2024 windows** | Bleeding risk with deep peripheral blocks | See ASRA timing table below; document reason and anticoagulation status |
| **Allergy to amide local anesthetics** | Risk of anaphylaxis | Ropivacaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine all amides; ester alternatives (procaine, chloroprocaine) not suitable for peripheral blocks due to short duration |

### Relative Contraindications (Shared Decision-Making)

| Contraindication | Considerations | Management Strategy |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Local skin infection at injection site** | Risk of introducing infection deeper | Defer blocks or choose alternative site; treat infection first |
| **Chronic pain on high-dose opioids** (>100 MME/day) | May have reduced block efficacy; opioid-induced hyperalgesia | Still offer blocks (reduce opioid requirements); set realistic expectations; consider higher-concentration local anesthetic |
| **Baseline sensory or motor deficits in operative limb** | Difficult to assess block success vs pre-existing deficit | Document baseline exam thoroughly; consider risk/benefit; blocks may still provide analgesia |
| **Severe spinal deformity** | Relevant if neuraxial also considered | Peripheral blocks (ACB/IPACK) not affected by spinal anatomy; proceed with caution if spinal/epidural planned |
| **Previous peripheral nerve injury in target area** | Risk of exacerbating injury or medicolegal concerns | Detailed informed consent; document baseline neuro exam; consider alternative pathway |
| **Anatomical difficulty** | Obesity, edema, prior surgery limiting ultrasound visualization | Attempt with experienced practitioner; have backup plan (surgeon infiltration, OFIA block-free pathway) |

### ASRA 2024-2025 Anticoagulation Timing Reference

**Applicable for deep peripheral blocks (ACB, IPACK - treated like neuraxial per ASRA):**

| Anticoagulant | Preoperative Hold Time | Postoperative Restart | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **DOACs** (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) | ≥72 h (CrCl >50 mL/min)<br>≥120 h (CrCl <50 mL/min) | ≥6 h after block removal | Verify last dose timing; check renal function |
| **Dabigatran** | 72–120 h depending on renal function | ≥6 h after block removal | CrCl <50: extend to 96-120 h; higher bleeding risk |
| **Warfarin** | INR ≤1.4 (check day of procedure) | Per surgical team | Must document INR <1.4 before block |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg q12h) | ≥24 h | ≥24 h after block | Higher risk than prophylactic dosing |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** (enoxaparin 40 mg daily) | ≥12 h | ≥6 h after block | Standard DVT prophylaxis dosing |
| **Aspirin** | No hold required | Continue | ASRA: safe for peripheral blocks |
| **Clopidogrel** | No hold required (controversial) | Continue | ASRA 2024: generally safe; some institutions still hold 5-7 days |
| **NSAIDs** | No hold required | Continue | Safe for peripheral blocks |

**Key Points:**
- Document anticoagulation status and timing in pre-op checklist
- If outside ASRA windows → choose OFIA block-free or conventional pathway
- Resumption timing must balance VTE prophylaxis vs bleeding risk
- Communicate timing with surgical team and PACU

### Local Anesthetic Safety for ACB + IPACK

**Standard Dosing:**
- **ACB:** 20-30 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25% (50-75 mg)
- **IPACK:** 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25% (40-50 mg)
- **Total dose:** Typically 90-125 mg ropivacaine

**Maximum Safe Doses:**
- Ropivacaine plain: ~3 mg/kg (~210 mg for 70 kg patient)
- Ropivacaine with epinephrine: ~7 mg/kg (rarely used for peripheral blocks)
- Our protocol well below maximum for patients >40 kg

**LAST Preparedness:**
- **Lipid emulsion 20% must be immediately available** in block area and OR
- Early recognition critical (see Section 8)
- Treatment protocol posted in block area
- Annual LAST drills recommended for block team

## 3. Opioid-Inclusive Pathway – Relative Contraindications

These patient factors **strongly favor** choosing OFIA + ACB/IPACK instead of conventional opioid-based pathway:

### Respiratory Concerns (Highest Priority)
- **Severe or untreated OSA** (STOP-Bang ≥5 + witnessed apneas, AHI >30)
- **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome** (BMI >40 + daytime hypercapnia)
- **COPD or chronic respiratory disease** requiring home O₂ or baseline PaCO₂ >45
- **History of post-op respiratory failure** or prolonged ventilation after prior anesthetics
- **Neuromuscular disease** (myasthenia gravis, ALS, muscular dystrophy - impaired cough/glottic closure)

### Cognitive/Delirium Risk
- **Frail elderly with high delirium risk** (age >80, baseline cognitive impairment, MMSE <24)
- **History of post-operative delirium** with prior opioid anesthesia
- **Dementia or baseline confusion** (opioids worsen cognitive status)

### Gastrointestinal Concerns
- **History of severe PONV** with prior opioid anesthesia (multiple antiemetics required)
- **History of prolonged post-op ileus** (opioid-related bowel dysfunction)
- **Gastroparesis or severe reflux** (aspiration risk with opioid-induced sedation)

### Patient Preference
- **Patient preference for opioid avoidance** after counseling on risks/benefits
- **Desire for rapid recovery and early mobilization** (ERAS goals)
- **Previous negative experience with opioids** (severe nausea, confusion, dysphoria)

### Clinical Pearl:
Even for **chronic opioid users**, consider OFIA + blocks as first-line. Patients still receive their baseline opioid dose, but avoid intraoperative opioid escalation. Outcomes often superior to conventional pathway.

## 4. Agents to Avoid Routinely in rTKA (2024–2025 Consensus)

| Agent | Reason (Evidence Level) | Key References | Alternative |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Gabapentinoids** (gabapentin, pregabalin) | Increase dizziness, delirium, respiratory suppression in elderly TKA patients; provide **no additional opioid-sparing benefit** when combined with modern multimodal regimens (acetaminophen, NSAIDs, dexamethasone, regional blocks); increased sedation and falls risk; ASA/APSF 2024 safety warning | Angst 2024 (meta-analysis); Memtsoudis 2023 (large database study); ASA/APSF 2024 Practice Advisory | Modern multimodal analgesia without gabapentinoids |
| **Routine intraoperative opioids in opioid-naïve patients** | Higher PONV (2-3x increase: 30-40% vs 10-15% with OFIA), respiratory depression (especially OSA, elderly), ileus, delayed mobilization, increased delirium risk in elderly, no improvement in pain scores when regional blocks used | Soffin 2023; ERAS 2024 Guidelines; Memtsoudis 2019 | OFIA with ACB/IPACK or OFIA block-free with multimodal adjuncts |
| **High-dose dexamethasone** (>10 mg) | No added analgesic benefit beyond 8-10 mg; unnecessary hyperglycemia risk (especially diabetics); no improvement in PONV prophylaxis above 8 mg; potential wound healing concerns at very high doses | De Oliveira 2022 (dose-response meta-analysis); Li 2024 | Dexamethasone 8-10 mg IV (sweet spot for PONV + analgesia) |
| **Large bolus dexmedetomidine loading** (>1 mcg/kg or rapid administration) | Increased bradycardia (up to 30% incidence) and hypotension vs slow infusion; no benefit over slow loading (0.5 mcg/kg over 10-20 min); reflex hypertension with rapid bolus | Li 2017; Blaudszun 2012; multiple case reports of severe bradycardia | Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg over 10-20 min (optional), then 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hr infusion |
| **Droperidol** (unless PONV rescue) | QT prolongation concerns; FDA black box warning; requires pre-op ECG; better alternatives available (ondansetron, dexamethasone, scopolamine) | FDA 2001 Black Box Warning; SAMBA Guidelines 2020 | Multimodal PONV prophylaxis (dexamethasone + ondansetron + scopolamine for high risk) |

## 5. Dose Adjustments for Special Populations

### 5.1 Frail / Older Adults (>70 years, frailty index >0.3, or Clinical Frailty Scale ≥5)

**Physiologic Changes:**
- Reduced hepatic/renal clearance → prolonged drug effect
- Increased brain sensitivity → enhanced CNS depression
- Reduced cardiac reserve → hypotension risk
- Increased delirium risk with sedatives/opioids

**Dose Adjustments:**

| Agent | Standard Dose | Frail/Elderly Dose | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Midazolam** | 1-2 mg IV | **1 mg IV** or avoid if very frail | Risk of prolonged sedation, paradoxical agitation, delirium |
| **Propofol induction** | 1.5-2 mg/kg | **1-1.5 mg/kg** | Increased sensitivity, hypotension risk; titrate slowly |
| **Ketamine induction** | 0.3-0.5 mg/kg | **0.2-0.3 mg/kg** (max) | Reduce psychomimetic risk; lower doses still effective |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hr | **0.2-0.4 mcg/kg/hr** | Increased bradycardia risk; avoid loading dose >0.5 mcg/kg |
| **Magnesium** | 40 mg/kg (30-50 range) | **30 mg/kg** | Reduced renal clearance; monitor reflexes |
| **Sevoflurane** | 0.8-1.2 MAC | **0.6-0.8 MAC** | Minimize delirium risk; BIS monitoring helpful |
| **Opioids (if used)** | Hydromorphone 0.2 mg | **Hydromorphone 0.1 mg** | 50% dose reduction; titrate carefully with extended intervals |

**Additional Considerations:**
- Avoid benzodiazepines if possible (delirium risk)
- Prefer regional blocks (reduce systemic medication requirements)
- Extended PACU monitoring
- Delirium screening (CAM-ICU) in PACU and floor
- Enhanced mobility protocols to prevent deconditioning

---

### 5.2 Cardiac Disease (CAD, HFrEF, Valvular Disease, Arrhythmias)

**Physiologic Concerns:**
- Fixed cardiac output states (AS, MS, severe HFrEF)
- Myocardial ischemia with tachycardia or hypotension
- Arrhythmia risk with sympathomimetic agents
- Limited hemodynamic reserve

**Dose Adjustments:**

| Agent | Cardiac Consideration | Management Strategy |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Propofol** | Dose-dependent negative inotropy and vasodilation | Slow induction (over 60-90 sec); reduce dose to 1-1.5 mg/kg; consider phenylephrine ready; **alternative: etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg** for severe dysfunction |
| **Ketamine** | Increased HR/BP via sympathetic stimulation | Limit to ≤0.3 mg/kg induction; avoid in severe CAD or recent MI (<3 months); acceptable in HFrEF (mild inotropic support) |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | Bradycardia, hypotension, decreased contractility | Avoid in severe bradycardia (HR <55); slow infusion only (no bolus); monitor closely; have glycopyrrolate ready |
| **Sevoflurane** | Mild myocardial depression, vasodilation | Well-tolerated at 0.8-1.0 MAC; avoid >1.2 MAC; maintain preload and afterload |
| **Vasopressors** | Maintain coronary perfusion pressure | **Phenylephrine preferred** (pure alpha, less tachycardia); avoid ephedrine in CAD (tachycardia increases O2 demand) |

**Hemodynamic Goals:**
- **Maintain MAP >65 mmHg** (coronary perfusion pressure)
- **Avoid tachycardia** (HR <100 ideal for CAD patients)
- **Maintain adequate preload** (gentle fluid administration)
- **Slow titration** of all agents (avoid abrupt hemodynamic changes)

**Specific Conditions:**
- **Severe AS:** Maintain preload, avoid hypotension, phenylephrine ready; etomidate induction preferred
- **HFrEF (EF <30%):** Avoid negative inotropes; ketamine acceptable; consider arterial line
- **Recent MI (<6 weeks):** Consider delaying elective surgery; if urgent: invasive monitoring, cardiology consult

---

### 5.3 Renal Impairment

**Classification:**
- **Mild:** CrCl 60-89 mL/min (minimal adjustments)
- **Moderate:** CrCl 30-59 mL/min (some adjustments)
- **Severe:** CrCl 15-29 mL/min (significant adjustments)
- **ESRD:** CrCl <15 or dialysis-dependent (major adjustments)

**Dose Adjustments:**

| Agent | CrCl >50 | CrCl 30-50 | CrCl <30 | Rationale |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Magnesium sulfate** | 40 mg/kg standard | **30 mg/kg** (reduce 25%) | **Avoid** | Renal excretion; toxicity risk with accumulation |
| **Midazolam** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Standard dose | Hepatic metabolism; no adjustment needed |
| **Propofol** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Standard dose | Hepatic metabolism; no adjustment needed |
| **Sevoflurane** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Standard dose | Pulmonary excretion; no adjustment needed |
| **Ketamine** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Consider 25% reduction | Active metabolites accumulate; usually well-tolerated |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Consider 25-50% reduction | Reduced clearance in severe disease |
| **Rocuronium** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Extend dosing interval | Prolonged effect; monitor TOF closely |
| **Sugammadex** | Standard dose | Standard dose | Standard dose | Safe in renal failure; not removed by dialysis |

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Avoid nephrotoxic agents:** NSAIDs contraindicated if CrCl <30 (use acetaminophen only)
- **Fluid management:** Avoid overload; consider arterial line if ESRD
- **Dialysis timing:** Coordinate with nephrology (usually skip day of surgery, resume POD 1)
- **Anemia:** Common in CKD; optimize pre-op if possible (ESAs, iron)
- **Electrolytes:** Check K+ pre-op (hyperkalemia risk); avoid potassium-containing fluids

---

### 5.4 Hepatic Impairment

**Classification (Child-Pugh Score):**
- **Class A (5-6 points):** Mild impairment - minimal adjustments
- **Class B (7-9 points):** Moderate impairment - dose reductions
- **Class C (10-15 points):** Severe impairment - major adjustments, high risk

**Dose Adjustments:**

| Agent | Mild (Child A) | Moderate (Child B) | Severe (Child C) | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Propofol** | Standard dose | Standard dose | **Reduce 25-50%** or avoid | Reduced clearance; prolonged effect; use with caution |
| **Midazolam** | Standard dose | **Reduce to 1 mg** | **Reduce 50%** or avoid | Prolonged sedation; increased encephalopathy risk |
| **Ketamine** | Standard dose | Standard dose | **Reduce 25%** | Generally safe; metabolites may accumulate |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Use with caution | **Reduce 50%** | **Contraindicated** | LAST risk dramatically increased; avoid in Child B/C |
| **Acetaminophen** | 1 g q6h (4 g/day max) | 1 g q8h (3 g/day max) | **0.5-0.75 g q8h (2 g/day max)** | Hepatotoxicity risk; reduce dose and frequency |
| **NSAIDs** | Standard if no cirrhosis | **Avoid if ascites/coagulopathy** | **Avoid** | GI bleeding risk, renal impairment, fluid retention |

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Coagulopathy:** Check INR, plt count; may affect block decision
- **Ascites:** Difficult positioning; respiratory compromise risk
- **Encephalopathy:** Avoid sedatives; minimize opioids
- **Portal hypertension:** Avoid NSAIDs (bleeding risk)
- **Synthetic function:** Check albumin (affects protein-bound drug dosing)

---

### 5.5 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) / Obesity

**Risk Stratification (STOP-Bang Score):**
- **Low risk:** 0-2 points
- **Moderate risk:** 3-4 points (consider sleep study)
- **High risk:** 5-8 points (assume severe OSA)

**Key Principles:**
- **Prefer OFIA pathways** (opioids dramatically increase airway obstruction risk)
- **Regional blocks strongly recommended** (reduce systemic analgesic requirements)
- **Minimize sedatives** (midazolam, opioids)
- **Enhanced monitoring** (continuous pulse ox in PACU and floor)

**Dose Adjustments:**

| Agent | Standard Dosing | OSA/Obesity Adjustment | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Propofol induction** | 1.5-2 mg/kg TBW | **1.5-2 mg/kg LBW or IBW** | Dose on lean weight to avoid overdose; obesity = increased Vd for lipophilic drugs |
| **Midazolam** | 1-2 mg | **1 mg maximum** | High risk respiratory depression; avoid if possible |
| **Opioids** | Per pathway | **Avoid if possible; if used, reduce 25-50%** | Dramatically increased apnea risk; prefer OFIA |
| **Rocuronium** | 0.6-1 mg/kg | **0.6-1 mg/kg IBW** | Dose on ideal weight; monitor TOF |
| **Sugammadex** | 2-4 mg/kg | **2-4 mg/kg TBW** | Dose on actual weight (per manufacturer) |

**Positioning:**
- **Ramped position** for induction/intubation (ear-to-sternal-notch alignment)
- **Reverse Trendelenburg 15-30°** during case (improve ventilation)
- **Head of bed elevated** in PACU

**Airway Considerations:**
- **Assume difficult airway** until proven otherwise
- **Video laryngoscopy** strongly recommended
- **CPAP/BiPAP** in PACU and overnight if home user

**Monitoring:**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** mandatory in PACU and first 24 hours
- **Consider capnography** for high-risk patients overnight
- **Apnea/hypopnea monitoring**
- **Naloxone immediately available**

---

## 6. Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS) - Rare but Serious

**Definition:**  
Rare, potentially fatal complication of prolonged high-dose propofol infusion characterized by metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and cardiac failure.

**Incidence:**
- Very rare: ~1-2% with prolonged high-dose infusions
- **Not a concern for single rTKA case** (typical duration 1-3 hours)

**Risk Factors:**
- Prolonged infusion **>48 hours** at high doses **(>83 mcg/kg/min or >5 mg/kg/hr)**
- Young age (children > adults, but reported in adults)
- Critical illness
- High catecholamine/steroid doses
- Inadequate carbohydrate intake/mitochondrial dysfunction

**Clinical Manifestations:**
- Metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis, base deficit >10)
- Rhabdomyolysis (CK >10,000 U/L, myoglobinuria)
- Hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mmol/L)
- Acute kidney injury
- Cardiac dysfunction (heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, asystole)
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Hepatomegaly

**Prevention:**
- Limit infusion rates to **<83 mcg/kg/min** when possible
- Limit duration to **<48 hours** when possible
- Monitor for early signs: metabolic acidosis, elevated triglycerides, elevated CK
- Ensure adequate carbohydrate provision in ICU patients

**Management if Suspected:**
- **Stop propofol immediately**
- Switch to alternative sedation (benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine)
- Supportive care: hemodialysis for hyperkalemia/acidosis, ECMO for cardiac failure
- Notify ICU/critical care team

**Relevance to rTKA Protocols:**
- Our protocol uses **75-150 mcg/kg/min for 1-3 hours** - well within safe limits
- PRIS risk essentially **zero** for single arthroplasty case
- Included for completeness and practitioner awareness

## 7. Propofol Allergy – Alternative Induction Strategies

**Incidence:**  
True propofol allergy is rare (~1:10,000-20,000 anesthetics). Most "allergies" are actually:
- Injection pain (due to propofol formulation)
- Hypotension (pharmacologic effect, not allergy)
- Confusion with egg/soy allergy (see below)

**Documented Allergies Requiring Alternatives:**

1. **True propofol hypersensitivity** - Anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction documented to propofol itself
2. **Egg allergy** - Propofol emulsion contains egg lecithin (phosphatidylcholine)
   - Note: Most egg allergies are to egg white proteins, not lecithin
   - ASRA/ASA: Most egg-allergic patients can safely receive propofol
   - If severe egg anaphylaxis history → avoid propofol
3. **Soy allergy** - Propofol emulsion contains soybean oil
   - Note: Most soy allergies are to soy protein, not soy oil
   - Highly refined soy oil typically lacks allergenic proteins
   - If severe soy anaphylaxis history → avoid propofol

### Alternative Induction Agents for rTKA

| Agent | Dose | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Use Case |
|-------|------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Etomidate** | 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV | • Hemodynamic stability (excellent for cardiac patients)<br>• Rapid onset (30-60 seconds)<br>• Short duration (3-5 minutes)<br>• No histamine release<br>• Minimal respiratory depression | • Myoclonus (reduce with pretreatment fentanyl 1 mcg/kg or midazolam 1-2 mg)<br>• PONV (higher than propofol)<br>• Adrenal suppression (single dose minimal concern, avoid in sepsis)<br>• Injection pain (reduce with lidocaine pretreatment) | **BEST choice** for propofol allergy in rTKA; especially good for cardiac/unstable patients |
| **Ketamine** | 1-2 mg/kg IV (sole induction agent) | • Maintains airway reflexes<br>• Bronchodilation (excellent for asthma/COPD)<br>• Intrinsic analgesia<br>• Cardiovascular stability (preserves BP)<br>• Neuroprotective | • Increased ICP/IOP (contraindicated if elevated)<br>• Tachycardia/hypertension (avoid in uncontrolled HTN, severe CAD)<br>• Contraindicated in acute psychosis<br>• Emergence reactions (rare at induction doses with midazolam pretreatment)<br>• Increased salivation (consider glycopyrrolate) | Acceptable alternative; already part of OFIA protocols at lower doses; good for bronchospasm risk |
| **Sevoflurane** (inhaled induction) | 6-8% inspired concentration with 100% O2 | • No IV allergy concern<br>• Smooth induction if cooperative<br>• Familiar to practitioners<br>• No injection pain | • **Slower induction** (3-5 minutes vs 30 seconds IV)<br>• Excitement phase possible (Stage II anesthesia)<br>• Airway irritation (coughing, laryngospasm)<br>• Requires patient cooperation<br>• Less common in adult practice<br>• Difficult in anxious/uncooperative patients | Less ideal for adults; consider for children or very anxious adults who refuse/cannot tolerate IV access |

### Recommended Induction Sequence for Propofol Allergy in rTKA

**Preferred Approach (Etomidate-Based):**
1. **Midazolam 1-2 mg IV** (premedication to reduce myoclonus and anxiety)
2. **Pre-oxygenation** (100% FiO2 for 3-5 minutes)
3. **Optional: Fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg IV** (reduces etomidate myoclonus)
4. **Etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV** (induction agent)
5. **Ketamine 0.3-0.5 mg/kg IV** (OFIA pathways - analgesic component)
   - OR **Fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg IV** (conventional pathway)
6. **Rocuronium 0.6-1.0 mg/kg IV** (neuromuscular blockade)
7. **Maintain with Sevoflurane 0.8-1.2 MAC**

**Alternative Approach (Ketamine-Based for OFIA):**
1. **Midazolam 1-2 mg IV** (reduce emergence reactions)
2. **Pre-oxygenation**
3. **Optional: Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV** (reduce hypersalivation)
4. **Ketamine 1.5-2 mg/kg IV** (sole induction agent)
5. **Rocuronium 0.6-1.0 mg/kg IV**
6. **Maintain with Sevoflurane 0.8-1.2 MAC**
   - Continue ketamine infusion 0.1-0.25 mg/kg/hr per OFIA protocol

**Clinical Pearls for Propofol Allergy:**
- **Document allergy clearly** in EMR with specific reaction type (anaphylaxis, rash, etc.)
- **Pre-op discussion** with patient about alternative induction plan
- **Inform PACU** - no propofol for sedation (use dexmedetomidine or low-dose ketamine instead)
- **Etomidate is first choice** for most patients (hemodynamically stable, predictable, familiar)
- **Ketamine-based induction acceptable** for OFIA pathways (already using ketamine adjunct)
- **Avoid propofol for PACU sedation** - use dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.4 mcg/kg/hr or ketamine 0.1 mg/kg IV boluses

**Special Considerations:**
- **Egg/soy allergy history:** Verify severity before assuming propofol contraindicated
  - Mild egg/soy intolerance (GI upset, oral allergy syndrome) → propofol likely safe with caution and monitoring
  - Moderate allergy (urticaria, mild angioedema) → consider skin testing or avoid
  - Severe anaphylaxis history (respiratory compromise, cardiovascular collapse) → **avoid propofol, use etomidate**
- **Previous "propofol allergy" documentation:** Clarify exact reaction (many are not true allergies)
  - Injection pain → not true allergy, propofol acceptable (use lidocaine co-injection or larger vein)
  - Hypotension → pharmacologic effect not allergy, propofol acceptable with slow administration
  - Rash, bronchospasm, hypotension with rash, anaphylaxis → **true allergy, use alternatives**
- **Most patients with egg/soy allergy can safely receive propofol** (allergenic proteins not present in highly refined lecithin/oil)

## 8. Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) Preparedness

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of regional anesthesia. All practitioners performing ACB/IPACK blocks must be prepared for immediate recognition and treatment.

### 8.1 Prevention Strategies

**Dose Limitation:**
- **Maximum safe doses:**
  - Ropivacaine plain: ~3 mg/kg (~210 mg for 70 kg patient)
  - Ropivacaine with epinephrine: ~7 mg/kg (rarely used for peripheral blocks)
- **Our protocol dosing:**
  - ACB: 20-30 mL of 0.2-0.25% ropivacaine = 40-75 mg
  - IPACK: 20 mL of 0.2-0.25% ropivacaine = 40-50 mg
  - **Total: 80-125 mg** (well below maximum for patients >40 kg)
- **Document total dose** in anesthesia record

**Injection Technique:**
- **Negative aspiration before each injection** (check for intravascular placement)
- **Incremental dosing** (inject 5 mL aliquots with frequent aspiration)
- **Ultrasound guidance** (visualize spread, avoid vascular structures)
- **Slow injection** (allow time for symptom recognition)
- **Communicate with patient** during awake blocks (early symptom reporting)

**Equipment Preparedness:**
- **Lipid emulsion 20% immediately available:**
  - In block area (100-250 mL)
  - In OR (100-250 mL)
  - Check expiration dates quarterly
- **LAST treatment poster** displayed in block area
- **Resuscitation equipment:** Oxygen, airway equipment, suction, defibrillator
- **Emergency medications:** Benzodiazepines, vasopressors, atropine

### 8.2 Early Recognition - Signs and Symptoms

**CNS Toxicity (Appears First):**

*Early/Mild CNS Symptoms:*
- Perioral numbness ("numb lips")
- Metallic taste
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
- Auditory changes
- Lightheadedness
- Visual disturbances

*Progressive CNS Symptoms:*
- Confusion, disorientation
- Slurred speech
- Agitation, restlessness
- Muscle twitching
- **Seizures** (tonic-clonic)

**Cardiovascular Toxicity (Appears Later, More Severe):**
- Hypertension (early)
- Tachycardia (early)
- **Bradycardia** (ominous sign)
- **Hypotension**
- Ventricular arrhythmias (VT, VF)
- **Cardiovascular collapse**
- Asystole

**Key Points:**
- CNS symptoms typically precede cardiovascular collapse (except with rapid IV injection)
- Bupivacaine has narrower safety margin than ropivacaine (CV collapse with less warning)
- **Any CNS symptom during/after block = stop injection immediately**

### 8.3 Treatment Protocol (ASRA 2017, Updated 2024)

**Immediate Actions:**

**STEP 1: STOP LOCAL ANESTHETIC INJECTION**
- Immediately discontinue injection
- Announce: **"Local anesthetic toxicity"** or **"LAST protocol"**

**STEP 2: CALL FOR HELP**
- Activate emergency response
- Request lipid emulsion (if not immediately available)
- Assign roles: airway manager, lipid administrator, code leader, recorder

**STEP 3: AIRWAY MANAGEMENT**
- **100% oxygen** via face mask or bag-mask ventilation
- **Ventilatory support** as needed
- **Consider early intubation** if:
  - Severe CNS symptoms (decreased consciousness, seizures)
  - Inadequate ventilation
  - Risk of aspiration

**STEP 4: SEIZURE MANAGEMENT (if present)**
- **Benzodiazepine first-line:**
  - Midazolam 1-2 mg IV (may repeat q2-3 min)
  - OR Lorazepam 2-4 mg IV
- **AVOID PROPOFOL** for seizures (can worsen cardiac toxicity)
- **Avoid large-dose barbiturates** (can worsen hypotension)

**STEP 5: LIPID EMULSION THERAPY (CORNERSTONE OF TREATMENT)**

**Initial Bolus:**
- **20% lipid emulsion 1.5 mL/kg** (lean body weight) over 1 minute
- For 70 kg patient: **~100 mL bolus**
- Use dedicated large-bore IV if available

**Continuous Infusion:**
- **0.25 mL/kg/min** (15 mL/kg/hr)
- For 70 kg patient: **~18 mL/min or 1000 mL/hr**
- Continue for **at least 10 minutes after circulatory stability achieved**

**Repeat Bolus (if needed):**
- If cardiovascular instability **persists or recurs** after initial bolus:
  - Repeat 1.5 mL/kg bolus (up to **2 additional boluses**)
  - Continue infusion

**Maximum Cumulative Dose:**
- **~10 mL/kg over first 30 minutes**
- For 70 kg patient: **~700 mL total**
- Rarely need to exceed this dose

**STEP 6: CARDIOVASCULAR SUPPORT**

**If Hypotension:**
- **Small-dose vasopressors:**
  - Phenylephrine 50-100 mcg IV boluses
  - Ephedrine 5-10 mg IV boluses
  - Epinephrine 10-20 mcg IV boluses (if severe)
- **Avoid large-dose epinephrine** (>1 mcg/kg) - may impair lipid resuscitation

**If Bradycardia:**
- Atropine 0.5-1 mg IV
- Consider epinephrine if refractory

**If Cardiac Arrest:**
- **Standard ACLS with modifications:**
  - **Continue lipid emulsion** (bolus + infusion)
  - **Small-dose epinephrine** (initial dose ≤1 mcg/kg)
  - **Avoid vasopressin** (may impair lipid effectiveness)
  - **Amiodarone preferred** over lidocaine for VF/VT
  - **Prolonged resuscitation may be required** (>60 minutes reported)
  - **Consider ECMO/CPB** if available and refractory arrest

**STEP 7: POST-RESUSCITATION CARE**

- **ICU admission** for monitoring (minimum 4-6 hours, longer if symptomatic)
- **Monitor for:**
  - Recurrent cardiovascular instability (lipid redistribution)
  - Pulmonary complications (lipid infusion can cause ARDS)
  - Pancreatitis (rare, from lipid overload)
- **Serial labs:** Lipase, triglycerides, troponin, lactate
- **ECG monitoring** continuous x24 hours
- **Neurology evaluation** if prolonged seizures or altered consciousness

☐ Cardiovascular support:
   ☐ Small-dose vasopressors PRN
   ☐ Avoid large-dose epinephrine (>1 mcg/kg)
☐ If arrest: ACLS + continue lipid + consider ECMO
☐ ICU admission for monitoring
```

### 8.5 Prevention Checklist (Before Every Block)
```
☐ Lipid emulsion 20% immediately available (check location, expiration)
☐ Resuscitation equipment ready (oxygen, airway, suction, defibrillator)
☐ Calculate maximum safe dose for patient weight
☐ Confirm negative aspiration before each injection
☐ Incremental injection technique (5 mL aliquots)
☐ Communicate with patient (awake blocks - ask about symptoms)
☐ Monitor vital signs during and after block
☐ Document total local anesthetic dose
```

## 9. Clinical Pearls

### 9.1 Standard Agents (Used Across ALL Pathways)

**Midazolam:**
- Standard preoperative anxiolytic (1-2 mg IV in holding area)
- Does not compromise OFIA principles (not an opioid, minimal respiratory depression at low doses)
- Provides anxiolysis + amnesia for block placement
- Reduce to 1 mg in elderly/frail
- Onset 1-3 minutes, duration 30-60 minutes

**Propofol:**
- **Universal induction agent** at UW and most institutions (1.5-2 mg/kg IV)
- Used for ALL three pathways regardless of maintenance choice
- Alternative: TIVA maintenance (75-150 mcg/kg/min) instead of sevoflurane
- Dedicated IV line recommended for infusion
- Dose-dependent hypotension - have phenylephrine ready

**Sevoflurane:**
- **Primary maintenance option** (0.8-1.2 MAC) - most common at UW
- Alternative to propofol TIVA after propofol induction
- Easily titratable, favorable recovery profile
- Well-tolerated in cardiac patients
- Preferred by many practitioners for ease of use

### 9.2 Maintenance Agent Selection (After Propofol Induction)

**Choose Sevoflurane for:**
- Standard workflow and ease of titration
- Established institutional preference (very common at UW)
- Hemodynamic stability
- Quick offset when discontinued
- Practitioner comfort and familiarity

**Choose Propofol TIVA for:**
- **High PONV risk** (STOP-Bang ≥3, female, non-smoker, history of severe PONV)
- **MH susceptibility** or family history of MH
- **Practitioner preference** or research protocols
- Potentially smoother emergence in select patients
- Desire to avoid volatile agents

**Both maintenance options are equally safe and effective** - choice based on patient factors and institutional/practitioner preference.

### 9.3 OFIA Adjuncts

**Ketamine:**
- Sub-anesthetic doses (0.1-0.25 mg/kg/hr infusion) have **minimal psychomimetic effects**
- Safe and effective in OFIA protocols
- NMDA antagonism provides analgesia and reduces opioid tolerance
- Induction doses (0.3-0.5 mg/kg) generally well-tolerated with midazolam pretreatment
- Emergence reactions rare with modern dosing protocols

**Dexmedetomidine:**
- **Infusion-only approach** (0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hr) minimizes bradycardia/hypotension
- Avoid large bolus loading (>1 mcg/kg or rapid administration)
- Optional slow loading: 0.5 mcg/kg over 10-20 minutes
- Lower infusion range (0.2-0.4 mcg/kg/hr) for elderly/frail
- Stop 10-15 minutes before emergence to allow clearance
- **Glycopyrrolate 0.2-0.4 mg IV preferred** over atropine for bradycardia (longer duration, less rebound tachycardia)

**Magnesium:**
- Provides additional NMDA antagonism and opioid-sparing effect
- Minimal side effects when infused slowly (over 15-20 minutes)
- Typical dose 30-50 mg/kg (40 mg/kg = ~3 g for 70 kg patient)
- Enhances neuromuscular blockade (may prolong rocuronium effect by 15-25%)
- Reduce dose in renal impairment, avoid if CrCl <30

**Lidocaine Infusion:**
- Optional for block-free pathway (modest additional analgesia)
- Max 2 mg/kg/hr, total dose <300 mg intraoperatively
- Monitor for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, confusion)
- Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment
- Lipid rescue must be available

### 9.4 Regional Blocks

**Gold Standard for rTKA:**
- Regional blocks (ACB + IPACK) remain the **gold standard** for rTKA analgesia when not contraindicated
- Superior to systemic analgesia alone (lower pain scores, less opioid use, better patient satisfaction)
- Motor-sparing technique enables early mobilization (POD 0 ambulation)

**ACB + IPACK Combination:**
- Provides **circumferential knee analgesia** with minimal motor impairment
- ACB: anterior/medial knee (saphenous nerve, nerve to vastus medialis)
- IPACK: posterior knee capsule (terminal sensory branches)
- **Quadriceps strength preserved** (critical for early ambulation and fall prevention)
- Block duration: typically 12-18 hours (plan transition to oral multimodal)

**When Blocks Not Performed:**
- OFIA block-free pathway still superior to conventional opioid-based
- Surgeon periarticular infiltration critical (100-150 mL ropivacaine 0.2%)
- Higher rescue analgesia requirements expected (ketamine first-line)

### 9.5 Safety Priorities

**LAST Preparedness:**
- **Mandatory** when performing peripheral blocks
- Lipid emulsion 20% must be **immediately available** (not "somewhere in the hospital")
- All block practitioners must know LAST treatment protocol
- Annual drills recommended for block team
- Early recognition and immediate lipid therapy are key to good outcomes

**Enhanced Monitoring for Opioid-Based Pathway:**
- Respiratory depression risk (especially OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve)
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** in PACU mandatory
- Consider capnography for high-risk patients
- Naloxone 0.4 mg IV immediately available at bedside
- Lower threshold for ICU admission if respiratory concerns

**Dexmedetomidine Bradycardia:**
- Monitor HR closely during infusion
- Treat if HR <50 with symptoms OR HR <45 regardless
- **Glycopyrrolate 0.2-0.4 mg IV** preferred over atropine
- Stop infusion 10-15 minutes before emergence

**Frailty and Delirium Prevention:**
- Minimize sedatives (avoid benzodiazepines if possible in very frail)
- Prefer regional blocks (reduce systemic medication requirements)
- Multimodal analgesia without opioids when possible
- Early mobilization (POD 0 target)
- Reorient frequently, family presence, avoid restraints

### 9.6 Protocol Flexibility

**All protocols should maintain flexibility based on:**
- Patient-specific factors (comorbidities, allergies, preferences)
- Practitioner comfort and expertise (not all practitioners equally skilled with all techniques)
- Institutional resources and workflows (block room availability, PACU capabilities)
- Intraoperative course (hemodynamic instability, surgical complications)

**Key Principle:**
These protocols are **evidence-based templates**, not rigid algorithms. Clinical judgment and individualized care remain paramount.

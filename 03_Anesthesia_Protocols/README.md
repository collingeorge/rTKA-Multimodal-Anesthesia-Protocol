# Anesthesia Protocols

## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This directory contains three standardized anesthesia pathways developed for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), based on synthesis of 2023-2025 evidence, ERAS Society recommendations, ASA/APSF safety guidance, and ASRA 2024-2025 anticoagulation guidelines.

These protocols are intended as **educational, non-validated clinical frameworks** for understanding modern multimodal, opioid-sparing anesthesia approaches. They are not institutional policy and should always be adapted by supervising anesthesiologists.

## Contents

### Protocol 1: Opioid-Free Anesthesia with ACB + IPACK

**File:** [`Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md`](Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**
- First-line ERAS rTKA pathway
- Quadriceps-sparing regional anesthesia (ACB + IPACK)
- Ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and magnesium-based opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia
- Lowest PONV incidence and optimal early ambulation
- Preferred pathway for most patients

**Key Features:**
- ACB: 20-30 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25%
- IPACK: 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2-0.25%
- Complete circumferential knee analgesia
- Motor-sparing technique enabling same-day mobilization

### Protocol 2: Opioid-Free Anesthesia Without Blocks

**File:** [`Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md`](Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**
- Alternative pathway when nerve blocks are contraindicated or declined
- Relies on surgeon periarticular infiltration plus multimodal opioid-free anesthesia
- Higher early pain scores but fastest OR workflow
- Suitable for anticoagulation timing conflicts or patient preference

**Key Features:**
- No anesthesia-administered nerve blocks
- All medications via IV route
- Surgeon local anesthetic infiltration after patient asleep
- Optional lidocaine infusion for enhanced analgesia

---

### Protocol 3: Conventional Opioid-Based Anesthesia

**File:** [`Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md`](Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md)

**Summary:**
- Traditional opioid-inclusive general or spinal anesthesia
- Indicated for chronic opioid users, severe anxiety, or opioid-free contraindications
- Fentanyl or hydromorphone-based analgesia
- Higher PONV and sedation risk but familiar and reliable

**Key Features:**
- Standard multimodal adjuncts maintained
- Opioid titration during surgery
- Conventional PACU management
- Appropriate for specific patient populations

---

### Pathway Comparison Table

**File:** [`Protocol_Comparison_Table.md`](Protocol_Comparison_Table.md)

**Summary:**
Condensed one-page comparison of all three pathways including:
- Analgesia sources and mechanisms
- Regional anesthesia utilization
- Expected pain levels (PACU and 24-hour)
- Ideal patient populations
- Workflow implications
- Rescue strategies and backup plans

## Methodology

Protocols were developed through systematic synthesis of:

**Society Guidelines:**
- ERAS Society hip and knee arthroplasty guidelines (2019-2024 updates)
- ASRA 2024-2025 peripheral nerve block anticoagulation recommendations
- ASA/APSF 2023-2025 anesthesia safety guidance

**Primary Literature:**
- 2023-2025 randomized controlled trials on ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and magnesium sulfate
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on ACB, IPACK, and periarticular infiltration
- Comparative effectiveness studies of opioid-sparing techniques in arthroplasty

**Evidence Level:**
All recommendations represent Level 1 or Level 2 evidence with explicit grading provided in main repository documentation.

## Protocol Selection Guide

### Choose Protocol 1 (OFA + Blocks) when:
- Patient is opioid-naïve or low-tolerance
- No anticoagulation contraindications per ASRA 2024
- Goal is optimal ERAS compliance and early mobilization
- Patient accepts nerve block procedure
- Anesthesia team experienced with ultrasound-guided blocks

### Choose Protocol 2 (OFA No Blocks) when:
- Anticoagulation timing precludes safe nerve blocks
- Patient declines nerve blocks due to anxiety
- Simplified workflow needed
- Opioid-free approach still desired
- Surgeon comfortable with high-volume periarticular infiltration

### Choose Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Based) when:
- Patient on chronic opioid therapy
- Severe anxiety with preference for familiar approach
- Medical contraindications to opioid-free medications
- Patient preference after informed consent discussion
- Institutional factors favor traditional approach

## Clinical Implementation Notes

### Pre-Implementation Requirements
- Review institutional formulary for medication availability
- Verify anesthesia team credentialing for nerve blocks
- Confirm PACU nursing education on opioid-free pathways
- Establish ketamine rescue dosing protocols
- Coordinate with pharmacy for infusion preparations

### Workflow Integration
- Protocols designed for standard OR time allocation
- Nerve blocks add approximately 10-15 minutes to pre-incision time
- Consider dedicated block room for parallel processing
- PACU handoff templates provided separately

### Quality Metrics
Suggested monitoring for institutional implementation:
- Pain scores at PACU arrival, 2h, 12h, 24h
- Total opioid consumption (0-24 hours, MME)
- Time to first mobilization
- PONV incidence
- Patient satisfaction scores

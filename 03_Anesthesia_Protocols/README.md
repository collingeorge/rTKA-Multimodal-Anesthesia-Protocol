# Multimodal & Opioid-Free Anesthesia Protocols for Robot-Assisted TKA

This directory contains a complete set of standardized anesthesia pathways and supporting tools for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). All content is based on synthesis of 2023–2025 evidence, ERAS Society recommendations, ASA/APSF safety guidance, and ASRA 2024–2025 anticoagulation guidelines.

These documents are intended as **educational, non-validated clinical frameworks**. They are **not** institutional policy and must always be adapted by supervising anesthesiologists.

**Terminology Note:**  
“Opioid-free anesthesia” = **opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA)**.  
Postoperative opioid rescue remains available when clinically needed and **does not constitute pathway failure**.

## Directory Contents

### 1. Core Pathway Protocols

These files define the three primary rTKA anesthesia pathways.

#### Protocol 1 – Opioid-Free Anesthesia With ACB + IPACK

**File:** [`Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md`](Protocol_1_ACB_IPACK_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**

- ERAS-first-line pathway for rTKA  
- Quadriceps-sparing regional anesthesia (ACB + IPACK)  
- Ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and magnesium-based **opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia**  
- Lowest expected PONV and optimal early ambulation  
- Preferred pathway for most opioid-naïve patients

**Key Features:**

- ACB: 20–30 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25 %  
- IPACK: 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25 %  
- Motor-sparing analgesia enabling same-day mobilization  
- Full multimodal pre- and postoperative regimen

---

#### Protocol 2 – Opioid-Free Anesthesia Without Blocks

**File:** [`Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md`](Protocol_2_BlockFree_OFIA.md)

**Summary:**

- Alternative OFIA pathway when nerve blocks are **contraindicated or declined**  
- Relies on surgeon periarticular local anesthetic infiltration plus systemic multimodal non-opioid agents  
- Typically higher early pain scores (first 12–24 h) but **fastest OR workflow**  
- Suitable for anticoagulation-timing conflicts or patient preference against blocks

**Key Features:**

- No anesthesia-delivered peripheral nerve blocks (reason documented)  
- Surgeon local anesthetic infiltration after induction  
- Optional lidocaine infusion for enhanced analgesia  
- Maintains ketamine/dexmedetomidine/magnesium-based OFIA framework

---

#### Protocol 3 – Conventional Opioid-Based Anesthesia

**File:** [`Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md`](Protocol_3_OpioidBased.md)

**Summary:**

- Traditional **opioid-inclusive** general or spinal anesthesia  
- Intended for:
  - Chronic opioid users  
  - Patients with severe anxiety who prefer a familiar opioid-based approach  
  - Contraindications to OFIA agents  
- Uses fentanyl or hydromorphone intraoperatively with standard multimodal adjuncts

**Key Features:**

- Pre-op acetaminophen, celecoxib, and dexamethasone maintained  
- Fentanyl or hydromorphone titrated during surgery  
- Conventional PACU opioid management and monitoring  
- Clearly framed as a **fallback or special-indication pathway**

---

## Protocol Selection Guide

### Choose Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) when:

- Patient is opioid-naïve or opioid-sensitive  
- No anticoagulation contraindications per ASRA 2024  
- Goal is **maximal ERAS compliance** and earliest safe mobilization  
- Patient accepts nerve blocks after counseling  
- Anesthesia team is comfortable with ultrasound-guided ACB/IPACK

### Choose Protocol 2 (OFIA, No Blocks) when:

- Anticoagulation timing precludes safe nerve blocks  
- Patient declines blocks (needle aversion, prior bad experience, etc.)  
- OR workflow mandates minimal pre-incision delay  
- Opioid-free approach is still desired  
- Surgeon is comfortable performing **high-volume periarticular infiltration**

### Choose Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Based) when:

- Patient is on chronic opioid therapy or has high opioid tolerance  
- Severe anxiety and strong preference for traditional opioid-based anesthesia  
- Contraindications to OFIA agents (e.g., severe psych history, advanced conduction disease)  
- Institutional factors or supervising anesthesiologist judgment favor a traditional approach  
- Chosen **after informed consent** and documentation of alternatives

# Anesthesia Protocols

## Robot-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (rTKA)

This directory contains three standardized anesthesia pathways developed for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA), based on synthesis of 2023-2025 evidence, ERAS Society recommendations, ASA/APSF safety guidance, and ASRA 2024-2025 anticoagulation guidelines.

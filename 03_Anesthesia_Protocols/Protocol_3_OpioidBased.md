# Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

## 1. Purpose
Traditional anesthesia pathway for:
- Chronic opioid users  
- Patients requesting conventional anesthesia  
- Severe anxiety disorders  
- Cases where OFIA agents are contraindicated  

---

## 2. Preoperative Medications
- Acetaminophen **1 g PO**
- Celecoxib **400 mg PO** (if no contraindication)
- Dexamethasone **8 mg IV**
- Midazolam **1–2 mg IV** (anxiolysis/amnesia)

---

## 3. Induction
- Midazolam **1–2 mg IV** (if not given preoperatively)
- Propofol **1.5–2 mg/kg**
- Fentanyl **1–2 mcg/kg** OR hydromorphone **0.2–0.4 mg**
- Rocuronium as needed

---

## 4. Maintenance
- **Sevoflurane (0.8–1.2 MAC) or propofol infusion (75–150 mcg/kg/min)**
- Repeated fentanyl boluses PRN
- Optional ketamine **0.2–0.3 mg/kg** induction if opioid-tolerant
- Optional dexmedetomidine **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr**

---

## 5. Emergence
- Ondansetron **4 mg IV**
- Sugammadex PRN
- Extubate when awake and following commands
- Monitor carefully for:
  - Sedation
  - Respiratory depression (consider capnography)
  - PONV

---

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia
- Scheduled acetaminophen + NSAID
- Opioid rescue:
  - Hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV q10 min**
  - Oxycodone **2.5–5 mg PO q4–6h**
- Naloxone readily available

---

## 7. Notes
- Higher PONV and sedation risk compared to OFIA.
- Use only when clinically indicated.
- Midazolam provides anxiolysis without interfering with conventional opioid-based anesthesia.
- Sevoflurane preferred by many practitioners for ease of titration.

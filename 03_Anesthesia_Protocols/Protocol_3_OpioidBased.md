# Protocol 3 – Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia (rTKA)

Conventional, **opioid-inclusive** general anesthetic framework for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). This pathway is **not intended as the default ERAS strategy**; when feasible, **OFIA-based pathways (with or without blocks)** are generally preferred for opioid-naïve patients and ERAS optimization.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS guidance, ASA/APSF safety recommendations, and ASRA regional anesthesia/anticoagulation standards but **do not replace** institutional policy, credentialing, or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized.
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.
> - Elderly/frail, OSA, significant cardiopulmonary disease, advanced renal/hepatic impairment, and extremes of BMI require additional modification.

---

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway describes a **conventional opioid-inclusive general anesthetic** for rTKA and is generally **reserved for**:

- **Chronic opioid users** or high opioid tolerance (document baseline regimen and estimated MME/day).
- Patients who **request** a conventional opioid-based anesthetic after balanced counseling.
- Severe anxiety disorders not adequately controlled with standard anxiolysis and non-opioid strategies.
- Situations where core OFIA components are **contraindicated or discouraged**, for example:
  - Active psychosis (ketamine generally avoided).
  - Advanced AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided).
  - Severe renal impairment where certain adjuncts (e.g., magnesium) are not desired/appropriate.
- Cases where attending/institutional workflow strongly favors a conventional approach after shared decision-making and documentation.

> **Key principle:** This pathway is **not first-line** for ERAS; it is used when OFIA-based pathways are inappropriate, not desired, or not feasible.

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment
- Full history and physical:
  - ASA classification, airway exam, functional capacity (METs), allergies.
- **Opioid history (required):**
  - Baseline opioid regimen (drug, dose, route, schedule, estimated MME/day).
  - Prior perioperative analgesic responses and adverse effects.
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV risk, delirium/cognitive baseline, frailty (especially >70–80), OSA screening (STOP-Bang) and home CPAP/BiPAP use.
- Anticoagulation:
  - If regional blocks are considered, confirm against **ASRA timing** and local policy.

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed; Individualize)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op; adjust for liver disease/low body weight).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hours pre-op; or institutional NSAID alternative if appropriate).
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** after IV placement (monitor glucose in diabetics).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** for high PONV risk patients without contraindication.
- **Midazolam 0.5–2 mg IV** preop anxiolysis (use **≤1 mg** in elderly/frail/OSA; avoid if high delirium risk when feasible).
- **Continue baseline home opioids** morning of surgery for chronic opioid users per attending/pain service guidance.
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** in this population unless a specific indication exists (sedation/delirium/respiratory risk in select patients).

### 2.3 Regional Blocks (Optional but Often Beneficial)
Consider **ACB + IPACK** even in an opioid-based anesthetic when not contraindicated:
- Can reduce perioperative opioid requirements and improve early mobility.
- If performed:
  - Follow ASRA anticoagulation timing and local policy.
  - Ensure **LAST preparedness** (20% lipid emulsion immediately available).
  - Use technique/dosing from Protocol 1 as the reference standard.

## 3. Ketamine Guardrails (If Used as Adjunct)

Ketamine in this protocol is **optional** and should be treated as a **sub-anesthetic adjunct** (not a default primary induction agent).

**Use caution, reduce dose, or omit** ketamine when any of the following are present (non-exhaustive):
- **Hemodynamic instability** or escalating vasopressor requirement; suspected catecholamine-depleted physiology
- **Frailty / advanced age** with limited physiologic reserve (higher ASA class)
- Clinically significant **tachyarrhythmia risk** or contexts where sympathetic stimulation is undesirable
- Severe psychiatric disease with active psychosis (context-dependent)

**BIS/EEG caveat:** Ketamine can **increase BIS** and alter EEG-derived indices without reflecting inadequate hypnosis. Avoid titrating hypnotics to BIS alone after ketamine; correlate with clinical signs and raw EEG when available.

---

## 4. Induction

> Doses are typical adult ranges; reduce in frail/elderly/hemodynamically limited patients.

### 4.1 Pre-oxygenation
- 100% FiO₂ by tight mask for **3–5 minutes**.

### 4.2 Induction Sequence (Illustrative)
- **Midazolam 0.5–1 mg IV** (optional; consider prior preop dosing).
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (**primary hypnotic**; consider 1–1.5 mg/kg in frail/cardiac patients).
- **Opioid analgesic component (clinician judgment):**
  - **Fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg IV** *or*
  - **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV**
- **Optional (selection-dependent): Ketamine 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV** adjunct (see guardrails).
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** with TOF monitoring.

### 4.3 Airway Management
- ETT vs LMA based on aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, surgical requirements, positioning.
- Confirm placement with continuous ETCO₂ waveform; document Cormack–Lehane grade and adjuncts used.

## 5. Maintenance

### 5.1 Primary Maintenance (Propofol-First Backbone)
**Default hypnotic backbone:**
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to physiology and depth targets)

**Optional/additive volatile strategy (workflow-dependent):**
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)** may be used:
  - As a **hybrid** with propofol during transitions,
  - As a supplement to reduce propofol requirements,
  - Or per attending/institutional workflow for longer/more complex cases.

> Practical framing: **Propofol is always present as the primary hypnotic in this framework; sevoflurane is optional and workflow-dependent.**

### 5.2 Opioid Management (Intraoperative)
Goal: adequate analgesia while minimizing excess opioid burden.
- **Fentanyl 25–50 mcg IV boluses PRN** for surgical stimulation (institutional practice).
- Optional alternatives/supplements:
  - **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV boluses** (often later in case).
  - **Remifentanil infusion** may be used in some TIVA workflows per local practice; ensure a deliberate postoperative analgesia plan.

### 5.3 Optional Adjuncts (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (optional; dose-reduce in elderly/frail; monitor bradycardia/hypotension).
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr** (optional; see guardrails; generally favored for opioid tolerance rather than routine use).
- **Lidocaine infusion ~1 mg/kg/hr** optional per institutional policy; respect total dose ceilings and contraindications; monitor for toxicity.

### 5.4 Hemodynamic Management
- Target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (individualize for CAD/cerebrovascular disease).
- Typical vasopressor strategy (institution-dependent):
  - Phenylephrine bolus for hypotension with adequate HR
  - Ephedrine bolus for hypotension with relative bradycardia
- Avoid using opioids as the primary hemodynamic “blunting” tool at the expense of delayed emergence/respiratory risk.

### 5.5 Monitoring
- Standard ASA monitors + temperature.
- Agent analyzer if volatile used.
- Neuromuscular monitoring (TOF).
- Consider brain function monitoring (BIS/EEG) in elderly or high-risk cases; interpret cautiously if ketamine used.

## 6. Emergence

### 6.1 Late Intraoperative Period
- Review total opioid dose and timing of last bolus; avoid large opioid boluses close to extubation when possible.
- Discontinue adjunct infusions (dexmedetomidine/ketamine/lidocaine) per physiology and workflow, typically near closure.

### 6.2 At Skin Closure
- Taper hypnotics for emergence:
  - Reduce propofol infusion (e.g., ~50% step-down) and/or taper sevoflurane if used.

### 6.3 Reversal + PONV Prophylaxis
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** (opioid pathways carry higher PONV risk).
- **Sugammadex** per blockade depth and institutional policy (dose per TOF metrics).

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria (More Stringent With Opioids)
- Awake or easily arousable; following commands; minimal sedation.
- Adequate ventilation/oxygenation with acceptable mechanics.
- Objective neuromuscular recovery (TOF ratio ≥0.9).
- Hemodynamically stable.

Clinical pearl: maintain a **low threshold to delay extubation** if somnolent or hypoventilating—especially in OSA, elderly, or opioid-naïve patients.

### 6.5 Immediate PACU Monitoring
- Continuous SpO₂ monitoring is standard; consider capnography in high-risk phenotypes (OSA, obesity, elderly, high opioid exposure).

## 7. Postoperative Analgesia and Recovery

### 7.1 Expected Pain Profile (Trends)
- Without blocks: early pain commonly higher and more variable.
- With ACB/IPACK: early pain often lower with reduced rescue opioid needs.
- Opioid pathway patients often demonstrate higher risk of PONV and respiratory depression, particularly in OSA/elderly.

> These are **expected trends**, not rigid targets.

### 7.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia
- Acetaminophen + NSAID (if safe) remain foundational.
- Continue baseline home opioids for chronic opioid users with a bowel regimen and appropriate monitoring.

### 7.3 PACU Rescue (Titrate Carefully)
- Opioid rescue per institutional policy (e.g., small hydromorphone boluses with reassessment after each dose).
- Escalate monitoring intensity in high-risk phenotypes (OSA, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, high total opioid exposure).

### 7.4 Mobilization
- Mobilize when alert (RASS ~0), pain controlled, hemodynamically stable, and PONV controlled.
- Opioid-related sedation/PONV may delay early mobility relative to OFIA pathways.

## 8. Summary and Key Principles

- Protocol 3 is generally reserved for chronic opioid use, OFIA contraindications, or strong preference after counseling.
- **Propofol is the default hypnotic backbone** for induction and maintenance in this framework.
- **Sevoflurane is optional/additive** depending on workflow, case complexity, and attending preference.
- Regional analgesia (ACB/IPACK) remains beneficial when safe and feasible, even in opioid-inclusive anesthetics.
- Respiratory depression and delirium risk warrant conservative dosing and enhanced monitoring in OSA/elderly/frail patients.

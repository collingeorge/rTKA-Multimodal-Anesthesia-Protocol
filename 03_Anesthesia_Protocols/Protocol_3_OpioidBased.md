# Protocol 3 – Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia (rTKA)

Conventional, opioid-inclusive anesthetic pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). This document describes an **illustrative framework** for an opioid-based anesthetic; it is **not intended as a default ERAS pathway**. OFIA-based protocols with regional blocks remain **generally preferred first-line** for most patients.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS 2024, ASA/APSF 2024, and ASRA 2024–2025 guidance but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized, especially in elderly, frail, OSA, or significant comorbidity.  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Special populations (severe cardiopulmonary disease, advanced renal/hepatic impairment, extremes of BMI) require additional modification and may be better served by alternative pathways.

---

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway describes a **conventional, opioid-inclusive general anesthetic** for rTKA. It is generally **reserved for**:

- **Chronic opioid users** (>~30 MME/day for >3 months).
- Patients who **request conventional anesthesia** after balanced counseling about OFIA vs opioid-based options.
- Severe anxiety disorders **not adequately controlled** by standard anxiolysis and non-opioid approaches.
- Cases where key OFIA components are **contraindicated or strongly discouraged**, for example:
  - Active psychosis (ketamine generally avoided).
  - Advanced AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided).
  - Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) when magnesium and certain adjuncts are not desired.
- Situations where **patient or attending preference** favors a conventional approach after shared decision-making and documentation.

> **Key Principle:**  
> This pathway is **not first-line** for ERAS; it is used when OFIA-based techniques are inappropriate, not desired, or not feasible.

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment

- Full history and physical:
  - ASA classification, airway exam, functional status (METs), allergies.
- **Opioid history:**
  - Document **baseline opioid regimen** (drug, dose, route, schedule, MME/day).
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV history (opioid-based pathways → higher risk).
  - Delirium/cognitive status, frailty (especially >70–80 years).
  - OSA screening (STOP-Bang score) and home CPAP/BiPAP use.
- Anticoagulation:
  - If regional blocks are being considered, confirm status against **ASRA 2024–2025 timing**.

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed)

Typical adult regimen (individualize and adjust for renal/hepatic function):

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO**  
  - 30–60 minutes pre-op (max 4 g/day; reduce for low body weight or liver disease).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO**  
  - 1–2 hours pre-op (if no significant renal/CV or GI contraindication).
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV**  
  - After IV placement (PONV + analgesia synergy; monitor glucose in diabetics).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch**  
  - Evening prior or ≥2 hours pre-op for **high PONV risk** patients without contraindications.
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** in holding area  
  - Consider **1 mg or less** in frail/elderly/OSA; avoid in severe baseline cognitive impairment when possible.
- **Continue home opioid dose** morning of surgery for chronic opioid users (per pain/attending guidance).
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** in this population (ASA/APSF 2024 cautions – sedation, falls, respiratory risk).

### 2.3 Regional Blocks (Optional but Strongly Recommended)

Consider **ACB + IPACK** even in an opioid-based anesthetic:

- Substantially **reduces intra- and postoperative opioid requirements**.
- Improves **analgesia and early mobilization**, even if opioids are used.
- If blocks are performed:
  - Ensure compatibility with **ASRA 2024–2025 anticoagulation timing**.
  - Follow ACB/IPACK technique from the regional protocol:
    - Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (or less in frail) for block anxiolysis.
    - Ropivacaine 0.2–0.25% (typical 20–30 mL ACB, ~20 mL IPACK).
  - Ensure **LAST preparedness** (lipid emulsion 20% immediately available).

---

## 3. Induction

> Unless otherwise noted, doses below are typical for **otherwise stable adult patients**; reduce doses in frail, elderly, or hemodynamically unstable patients.

### 3.1 Pre-Oxygenation

- 100% FiO₂ via tight-fitting mask for **3–5 minutes** prior to induction.

### 3.2 Induction Sequence (Illustrative)

- **Midazolam 0.5–1 mg IV**  
  - Additional small doses as needed (consider prior pre-op midazolam dose).
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV**  
  - Typical induction range; **consider 1–1.5 mg/kg** in frail or cardiac patients.
- **Fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg IV**  
  - Typical 75–150 mcg for 70 kg patient, adjusted for tolerance and comorbidities.  
  - **OR** Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV (longer-acting, more potent).
  - **Opioid-tolerant patients:** may require higher induction doses; titrate carefully.
- **Optional: Ketamine 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV**  
  - Especially helpful for **opioid-tolerant** patients (NMDA antagonism, analgesia).  
  - Avoid or reduce in severe CAD, uncontrolled hypertension, or psychosis.
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
  - Based on ideal body weight; confirm depth with TOF.

### 3.3 Airway Management

- Endotracheal intubation vs LMA based on:
  - Surgical requirements, aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, positioning.
- Confirm placement:
  - **Continuous ETCO₂** waveform, auscultation as indicated.
- Secure airway device and document:
  - **Cormack–Lehane grade** and ease of intubation (for future reference).

## 4. Maintenance

### 4.1 Anesthetic Maintenance (Choose One)

- **Sevoflurane ~0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)**  
  - Common first choice at many centers for rTKA: titratable, familiar.
  - Adjust to maintain adequate depth while minimizing hypotension.
  
  **OR**

- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min**  
  - Consider in **high PONV risk**, MH susceptibility, or practitioner preference.
  - Dedicated IV line, infusion pump, and awareness of cumulative dose.

### 4.2 Opioid Management (Intraoperative)

> **Goal:** Provide adequate analgesia while avoiding excessive total opioid load.

- **Fentanyl 25–50 mcg IV boluses PRN**  
  - For hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation (tachycardia, hypertension).  
  - Typical total for 70 kg, opioid-naïve: **~200–400 mcg**  
  - **Opioid-tolerant patients:** may require **~500–1000+ mcg** total – these are **approximate ranges**, not targets.
- Alternatives / supplements:
  - **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV boluses PRN**, especially towards end of case.
  - **Remifentanil infusion 0.05–0.2 mcg/kg/min** if using propofol TIVA:
    - Be deliberate about **post-op analgesia plan**, as remifentanil has no residual effect.

### 4.3 Optional Adjuncts (Particularly for Opioid Tolerance)

- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr**
  - Reduces central sensitization and opioid tolerance.
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr**
  - Provides sedation and opioid-sparing; use lower range due to concurrent opioids.
  - Avoid or dose-reduce in bradycardia, AV block, or frailty.
- **Lidocaine infusion ~1 mg/kg/hr (max ~300 mg total)**
  - Additional analgesia; **avoid in severe hepatic impairment**.
  - Monitor for CNS toxicity; ensure lipid rescue available.

### 4.4 Hemodynamic Management

- **Target MAP ≥65 mmHg**, individualizing for CAD or cerebrovascular disease.
- Typical vasopressor strategy:
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** boluses if hypotension with HR >70.
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** boluses if hypotension with HR <60.
- Avoid:
  - Over-reliance on opioids to “blunt” hemodynamics at the expense of oversedation and respiratory depression.

### 4.5 Intraoperative Monitoring

- Standard ASA monitors:
  - ECG, NIBP or arterial line (per risk), SpO₂, ETCO₂, temperature.
- **Agent analyzer** for volatile anesthetic MAC (if using sevoflurane).
- Neuromuscular monitoring:
  - TOF monitoring throughout case if neuromuscular blockade used.
- Consider brain function monitoring (BIS or equivalent):
  - Particularly in elderly or in high-dose opioid + volatile combinations.

## 5. Emergence

### 5.1 Late Intraoperative Period (Before Skin Closure)

- Review:
  - **Total opioid dose** and timing of last bolus.
- Avoid:
  - Large opioid boluses within **~15 minutes** of planned extubation if possible.

### 5.2 At Skin Closure

- Adjust anesthetic:
  - Reduce sevoflurane toward **~0.5–0.7 MAC** or taper propofol infusion (~50% reduction).
- Stop adjunct infusions:
  - Ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and lidocaine typically discontinued at or shortly before closure.

### 5.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV**  
  - Particularly important given higher PONV risk with opioids.
- Neuromuscular reversal:
  - **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV** when **TOF count ≥2** but TOF ratio <0.9.  
  - **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV** for **deeper block** (1–2 post-tetanic counts).  
  - Adjust for weight and institutional practice.
- Consider **additional antiemetic** in very high risk patients:
  - e.g., metoclopramide 10 mg IV or promethazine 6.25 mg IV per local policy.

### 5.4 Extubation Criteria (More Stringent with Opioids)

- **Neurologic:**
  - Fully awake or easily arousable, following commands.
  - RASS ~0 to –1 (no deep sedation).
- **Ventilation:**
  - Tidal volume >5 mL/kg and RR ~10–20 bpm.
  - SpO₂ >92% on room air or minimal supplemental O₂.
  - No paradoxical or labored breathing.
- **Neuromuscular:**
  - TOF ratio ≥0.9 or objective confirmation of adequate reversal.
- **Hemodynamic:**
  - MAP ≥60–65 mmHg, HR ~50–100 bpm.

> **Clinical Pearl:**  
> With an opioid-based pathway, maintain a **low threshold to delay extubation** if somnolence or hypoventilation is present, especially in OSA, elderly, or opioid-naïve patients.

### 5.5 Immediate Post-Extubation Monitoring

- **Continuous pulse oximetry in PACU is mandatory.**
- Consider **capnography** for:
  - OSA, obesity, elderly, high total opioid dose, or combined risk factors.
- Monitor:
  - **Sedation**: RASS score q15 minutes.
  - **Respiratory status**: RR, pattern, SpO₂, apneic episodes.
  - **PONV**: treat early and aggressively.

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia and Recovery

### 6.1 Expected Pain Profile

- Without blocks:
  - **NRS ~3–6/10** in PACU and early post-op.
- With ACB/IPACK:
  - Often **NRS ~0–3/10** despite conventional anesthetic.
- Sedation and PONV:
  - Higher incidence than OFIA pathways (PONV often **~30–40%** vs <10% with OFIA + blocks).

### 6.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia

Continue or initiate:

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h**  
  - Max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease or low weight.
- **NSAID** (if no contraindication):
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h **OR**
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day, typically limited to 48–72h; check renal function) **OR**
  - Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily per surgical/medicine guidance.
- **Chronic opioid users:**
  - Continue **baseline home opioid regimen**, adjusted for bowel regimen and monitoring.

### 6.3 Opioid Rescue – PACU (Titrate Carefully)

- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN** for NRS ≥4:
  - Reassess **after each dose**: pain, sedation (RASS), RR, SpO₂.
  - For opioid-naïve patients, set a **cautious upper limit** (e.g., ~2 mg/4 hours).
- **Opioid-tolerant** patients:
  - May require higher doses; **consult acute pain service** if:
    - Needs exceed institutional thresholds (e.g., >2 mg/hr).

### 6.4 Transition to Oral Analgesia – Floor

- **Opioid-naïve / low baseline:**
  - Oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO q4–6h PRN for NRS ≥4, with maximum daily limits per policy.
- **Opioid-tolerant:**
  - Resume **home regimen** plus ~25–50% additional PRN dosing, with pain service input.
- Extended-release formulations (e.g., oxycodone CR):
  - Consider only if consistent with **institutional practice and pain service guidance**.

### 6.5 Safety Monitoring and Naloxone

- **Naloxone 0.4 mg IV** readily available at bedside.
  - Prepare by diluting to **0.04 mg/mL** and titrate **0.04 mg IV q2–3 minutes**:
    - Targets: RR ≥10, SpO₂ ≥90%, arousable.
    - Avoid abrupt full reversal unless necessary (withdrawal, severe pain).
- Enhanced monitoring indicated if:
  - OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3), age >70, opioid-naïve, high total opioid dose (>~300 mcg fentanyl equivalents), or significant comorbidity.
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** for high-risk patients for at least **~24 hours** post-op.
- Consider **overnight capnography** or higher-acuity setting (step-down/ICU) for:
  - Severe OSA, obesity hypoventilation, prior respiratory failure, or combined high-risk features.

### 6.6 Non-Pharmacologic Measures and Mobilization

- Non-pharmacologic:
  - Ice to surgical site, elevation, appropriate positioning, reassurance.
- Mobilization:
  - **Target**: Ambulation on **POD 1** (often later than OFIA pathways due to sedation/PONV).
  - PT evaluation when:
    - RASS ~0, pain ≤4/10, PONV controlled, hemodynamically stable, no concerning sedation.

## 7. Summary, Advantages, and Key Principles

### 7.1 Clinical Considerations

Compared with OFIA + blocks and OFIA block-free pathways, conventional opioid anesthesia tends to have:

- **Higher PONV** (often ~30–40% vs <10% with OFIA + blocks).
- **More sedation** and **longer PACU stays** (~90–120 minutes vs ~60–90).
- **Higher respiratory risk**, especially in OSA, elderly, and opioid-naïve patients.
- **Delayed mobilization**, typically POD 1 rather than POD 0.

### 7.2 Advantages of the Conventional Pathway

- **Familiar technique** for many practitioners.
- Often **perceived hemodynamic predictability** with opioid-based blunting of responses.
- **Appropriate for chronic opioid users** when OFIA is not desired or feasible.
- Widely understood PACU rescue patterns and protocols.

### 7.3 Key Principles (Protocol 3)

- This pathway is **generally reserved** for:
  - Chronic opioid users, OFIA contraindications, strong patient/practitioner preference, or severe anxiety not managed by other means.
- **Multimodal analgesia remains essential**:
  - Acetaminophen + NSAID (if safe) + regional if possible + non-opioid adjuncts.
- **Regional blocks (ACB + IPACK) are strongly recommended** when not contraindicated:
  - They can reduce total opioid requirements by ~30–50% even in an opioid-based pathway.
- **Monitor aggressively** for:
  - Respiratory depression, sedation, PONV, and delayed mobilization.
- Always consider whether an **OFIA-based pathway** might offer better risk–benefit for the specific patient.

### 7.4 Comparison to OFIA Pathways (Expected Trends)

|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pain control**       | NRS ~2–6 (variable)             | NRS ~0–3 (often excellent) | NRS ~3–6 (generally good)     |
| **PONV**               | Often ~30–40%                   | Often <10%                 | Often ~10–20%                 |
| **Sedation**           | More significant, prolonged     | Minimal                    | Minimal                       |
| **Mobilization**       | POD 1 typical                   | POD 0 (4–6 hrs)            | POD 0 (4–6 hrs)               |
| **Delirium risk (elderly)** | Higher                      | Lower                       | Lower                        |
| **Respiratory risk**   | Higher (OSA, elderly)           | Lower                      | Lower                         |
| **PACU LOS**           | ~90–120 min                     | ~60–90 min                 | ~60–90 min                    |

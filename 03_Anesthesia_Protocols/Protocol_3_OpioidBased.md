## Educational Use Only

**This protocol is an educational framework for discussion, training, and research documentation.** It is **not medical advice**, not a substitute for clinical judgment, and not an institutional guideline, policy, or order set.

**Critical Requirements:**
- All medication selection and dosing must be individualized to patient physiology, comorbidities, monitoring strategy, and local formulary/policies
- Supervision by a licensed attending anesthesiologist is mandatory
- Any clinical use requires formal local review and governance approval
- Institutional protocols supersede all recommendations herein

**Governance Lock:**  
This document intentionally avoids prescribing institution-specific opioid order sets, dosing mandates, or monitoring thresholds. Any operational use requires anesthesia department approval, pharmacy review, nursing workflow validation, and alignment with institutional opioid stewardship and postoperative monitoring policies.

**Special Populations:**
Elderly, frail, OSA, significant cardiopulmonary disease, renal/hepatic impairment, and extremes of BMI require dose reduction and enhanced monitoring beyond standard recommendations.

## 1. Purpose and Clinical Context

### 1.1 Protocol Objectives

This protocol provides a **conventional opioid-inclusive intraoperative anesthesia pathway** for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) that:

- Maintains a **multimodal analgesia foundation** while permitting intraoperative opioid administration
- Standardizes opioid delivery as a **continuous fentanyl infusion** with deliberate tapering (avoid late-case stacking)
- Preserves ERAS-compatible elements when feasible (PONV mitigation, early mobilization planning)
- Provides a structured alternative when OFIA pathways are **not desired, not feasible, or contraindicated**

### 1.2 Evidence Base

This protocol is informed by:
- ERAS-style arthroplasty enhanced recovery and multimodal analgesia guidance
- ASA/APSF perioperative safety communications relevant to opioid exposure and postoperative monitoring
- ASRA/ESRA regional anesthesia safety principles and anticoagulation governance
- Peer-reviewed literature on opioid stewardship, PONV prevention, and respiratory safety in high-risk phenotypes

**Complete evidence grading and citations:** See `../../07_References_Evidence_2024.md`

### 1.3 When to Use This Protocol

**Third-line pathway (typical indications):**
- Chronic opioid use / high opioid tolerance (document baseline regimen and estimated MME/day)
- Patient preference for opioid-inclusive approach after counseling
- OFIA adjunct contraindications or poor tolerance (phenotype-dependent), such as:
  - Active psychosis (ketamine generally avoided)
  - High-grade AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided)
  - Severe renal impairment where selected adjuncts (e.g., magnesium) are not desired/appropriate
- Institutional or attending workflow decision after individualized risk-benefit assessment

**Position in Algorithm:**
- When blocks feasible and safe → **Protocol 1** preferred (OFIA + ACB/IPACK)
- When blocks NOT feasible but OFIA appropriate → **Protocol 2** preferred (OFIA block-free)
- When OFIA pathways are inappropriate or undesired → **Protocol 3** (opioid-inclusive)

### 1.4 Key Difference from Protocol 1/2

- **Opioids are permitted intraoperatively** and are associated with higher PONV and respiratory depression risk
- PACU pain and rescue needs are **more variable**, especially if blocks are omitted
- Requires **more stringent emergence/extubation criteria** and **enhanced postoperative monitoring** in high-risk phenotypes

### 1.5 Decision Algorithm: When to Use Protocol 3 vs Protocol 1/2

**Clinical Decision Framework:**
```
START: Patient scheduled for rTKA
    |
    ├─> Regional blocks FEASIBLE and SAFE?
    |   ├─> YES → Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) [DEFAULT FIRST-LINE]
    |   └─> NO → Continue to next decision point
    |
    ├─> OFIA adjuncts appropriate and tolerated?
    |   ├─> YES → Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) [SECOND-LINE when blocks contraindicated]
    |   └─> NO → Continue to next decision point
    |
    ├─> Multiple OFIA contraindications OR chronic high-dose opioids OR patient/attending preference?
    |   ├─> YES → Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) [THIRD-LINE]
    |   └─> NO → Reassess clinical picture; consider Protocol 1 or 2 with dose modifications
```

**Key Decision Points:**

| Clinical Factor | Favors Protocol 1/2 | Favors Protocol 3 |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Regional blocks** | Feasible, safe, patient accepts | Contraindicated or refused |
| **Opioid tolerance** | Opioid-naïve or low-dose (<30 MME/day) | High-dose chronic use (>60–90 MME/day)* |
| **OFIA adjuncts** | Well-tolerated, no contraindications | Multiple contraindications (ketamine/dex/lidocaine) |
| **OSA severity** | STOP-Bang ≥3 (opioid-sparing critical) | Mild or controlled; OR Protocol 3 with enhanced monitoring |
| **Patient preference** | Prefers opioid-minimization after counseling | Strong preference for conventional approach after counseling |
| **Prior anesthesia** | Good tolerance of OFIA approach | Prior OFIA intolerance or complications |

*Threshold is contextual and institution-dependent; see Section 2.1 for details

**Documentation Requirement:** When selecting Protocol 3, document specific clinical rationale (e.g., "Chronic oxycodone 90 MME/day + gabapentin 1800 mg/day + active psychosis → ketamine/gabapentin contraindicated; Protocol 3 selected for opioid-based multimodal approach with enhanced monitoring").

---

## 2. Patient Selection Criteria

### 2.1 Ideal Candidates

**Consider Protocol 3 when:**
- Chronic opioid therapy or high opioid tolerance (e.g., **>60–90 MME/day** as a general reference; actual thresholds are **contextual and institution-dependent** based on patient response, procedure type, and multimodal alternatives available). **Document clearly:** baseline regimen, estimated MME/day, and rationale for Protocol 3 selection.
- Prior OFIA intolerance or contraindications to multiple OFIA adjuncts
- Strong preference for conventional opioid-inclusive anesthetic after counseling and documentation
- Clinical context where hemodynamic goals or anticipated stimulation favors opioid participation (attending judgment)

**Opioid Responsiveness vs Raw MME:**

The decision to use Protocol 3 should prioritize **patient-specific opioid responsiveness** rather than relying solely on MME calculations:

- **High responders:** Some patients at 40–60 MME/day may have excellent pain control with Protocol 1 or 2 when blocks are feasible
- **Poor responders:** Some patients at similar MME levels may have inadequate analgesia without intraoperative opioids
- **Complex pain phenotypes:** Neuropathic pain, central sensitization, or psychological comorbidities may influence opioid needs independent of baseline MME
- **Prior perioperative experience:** History of severe pain or inadequate analgesia with opioid-sparing approaches is often more predictive than MME alone

**Important Context on Opioid Tolerance Thresholds:**

- The 60–90 MME/day range is **not a hard cutoff** for Protocol 3 selection
- Many chronic opioid users at 30–60 MME/day may still do well with Protocol 1 or 2 when blocks are feasible
- Conversely, some patients at lower MME may have high sensitivity or complex pain phenotypes requiring opioid-inclusive approach
- **Decision-making should prioritize:** patient-specific physiology, multimodal options available, procedural factors, and shared decision-making with patient
- **Documentation is key:** clearly state why Protocol 3 was selected for any given patient

**Clinical Pearl:** If uncertain whether Protocol 2 or 3 is appropriate for a given chronic opioid user, consider patient history, pain phenotype, and multimodal options available. When in doubt, lean toward Protocol 2 with enhanced rescue planning rather than defaulting to Protocol 3.

### 2.2 When Protocol 3 Requires Enhanced Guardrails

**High-risk phenotypes for opioid-related harm:**
- OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3), obesity hypoventilation, severe obesity
- Elderly (>75) or frailty phenotype (delirium + hypoventilation risk)
- Significant cardiopulmonary disease
- Opioid-naïve with high sensitivity to sedatives/opioids
- Concomitant sedatives (benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, alcohol exposure)

**Actionable implication:** lower opioid dosing, earlier taper, avoid stacking near emergence, and increase monitoring intensity (capnography in PACU when available).

---

## 3. Preoperative Phase

### 3.1 Preanesthetic Assessment

**Standard evaluation:**
- Complete history and physical examination
- Airway assessment (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck mobility)
- Review prior anesthesia records (difficult airway, PONV, delirium, respiratory events)
- ASA physical status classification
- NPO status verification

**Required opioid history:**
- Baseline regimen (drug, dose, route, schedule)
- Estimated daily MME
- Previous perioperative opioid responsiveness and adverse effects
- Current bowel regimen and prior constipation history

**Risk factor identification:**
- OSA: STOP-Bang score; home CPAP/BiPAP use
- PONV risk: Apfel score
- Frailty/cognitive baseline: delirium history, baseline mental status
- Renal/hepatic function: relevant for multimodal options and safety

### 3.2 Regional Analgesia Planning (Optional but Often Beneficial)

- **ACB + IPACK can remain beneficial** even in Protocol 3 when safe and feasible
- If blocks performed:
  - Follow ASRA/institutional policy and anticoagulation governance
  - LAST preparedness per institutional standard (20% lipid emulsion immediately available)
  - Use Protocol 1 technique/dosing as the reference standard

- If blocks omitted:
  - Ensure surgeon periarticular infiltration is performed and documented (drug, concentration, volume, total mg)

### 3.3 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed Multimodal Foundation)

| Medication | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | PO/IV | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | If appropriate; alternatives per institutional policy |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8–10 mg | IV | Reduce to 4–6 mg if diabetic; monitor glucose |
| **Scopolamine patch** | 1.5 mg | Transdermal | Apfel ≥3; contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–2 mg | IV | Use ≤1 mg in elderly/frail/OSA; avoid if delirium-risk |

**Chronic opioids:** continue baseline morning dose for chronic opioid users per attending/pain service guidance.  
**Gabapentinoids:** avoid routine use unless specifically indicated per institutional policy.

---

## 4. Induction

> Induction achieves rapid, reliable loss of consciousness using propofol bolus. Opioids are used to blunt sympathetic response and provide analgesia, not to replace hypnosis.

### 4.1 Pre-Induction Checklist

- [ ] Patient correctly identified; procedure verified (Time Out)
- [ ] ASA standard monitors applied and functioning
- [ ] IV access confirmed patent (consider 2nd IV if infusions planned)
- [ ] Airway equipment prepared and checked
- [ ] Suction functioning
- [ ] Vasoactive medications prepared and labeled
- [ ] Quantitative TOF monitor available and functional

### 4.2 Induction Medications (Typical Adult Ranges)

- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg in elderly/frail/cardiac-limited)
- **Fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg IV** (titrate to phenotype and expected stimulation; avoid high dosing in OSA/elderly/frail)
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** with TOF monitoring
- **Midazolam 0–0.5 mg IV** only if needed (often omit if preop anxiolysis already given)

### 4.3 Optional Adjunct: Ketamine (Selection-Dependent)

- **Ketamine 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV** adjunct only (not default); apply guardrails
- Avoid in active psychosis; use caution in frail/elderly and hemodynamic instability
- **EEG/BIS caveat:** ketamine may increase BIS; do not titrate hypnotics to BIS alone

### 4.4 Airway Management

- ETT vs LMA per aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, surgical positioning, and attending judgment
- Confirm placement with continuous ETCO₂ waveform; document airway grade/adjuncts used

---

## 5. Maintenance Anesthesia

> Maintenance ensures continuous unconsciousness via propofol and/or sevoflurane while opioids provide analgesia. Avoid late-case opioid stacking to support safe emergence.

### 5.1 Maintenance Hypnosis (Choose One)

#### Option A: Propofol TIVA (Propofol-First Backbone)
- **75–150 mcg/kg/min**, titrate to physiology and depth targets
- **Typical range with active opioids: 75–125 mcg/kg/min**
- **>125 mcg/kg/min is uncommon** when opioids are providing adequate analgesia
  - If requiring >125 mcg/kg/min persistently, reassess:
    - Opioid balance (inadequate analgesia may manifest as increased hypnotic requirement)
    - Stimulation level (tourniquet, retraction, extreme surgical stimulation)
    - Adjunct contribution (are optional adjuncts functioning as intended?)
- Consider processed EEG in elderly/high-risk cases to avoid excessive depth

#### Option B: Sevoflurane (Workflow-Dependent)
- **0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)**, with agent monitoring

#### Option C: Balanced (Propofol + Sevoflurane)
- Reduced doses of each; use experienced titration strategy

### 5.2 Opioid Delivery (Infusion-First Strategy)

**Fentanyl infusion (preferred framing for Protocol 3):**
- Start **0.5–2.0 mcg/kg/hr** (typical starting range ~0.5–1.0 mcg/kg/hr)
- Titrate to stimulation and phenotype
- **Taper/stop 20–30 minutes before planned emergence** (earlier in OSA/elderly/frail/opioid-naïve)

**Hydromorphone (optional end-of-case planning):**
- **0.2–0.6 mg IV total**, small increments with reassessment  
- Avoid stacking close to extubation in OSA/elderly/frail

### 5.3 Optional Adjuncts (Selection-Dependent)

- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (no bolus; bradycardia/hypotension vigilance)
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr** (often most useful for opioid tolerance; apply guardrails)
- **Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr** per institutional policy; monitor for toxicity; respect contraindications

**Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Institution-Dependent):**
- **1–2 mg/kg/hr** per institutional policy
- **Critical safety requirements:**
  - Strict weight-based dosing (calculate ideal body weight in obesity)
  - Monitor for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, dizziness, confusion, seizures)
  - **Reduce to 1 mg/kg/hr maximum** in elderly (>75), low body mass (<50 kg), or hepatic dysfunction
  - **Stop immediately** if any signs/symptoms of toxicity
  - **Do NOT exceed institutional maximum rate and duration** (commonly 1–2 mg/kg/hr for ≤2–3 hours)
  - **Track cumulative local anesthetic exposure** when combined with surgeon infiltration
- **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), complete heart block, amide LA allergy, severe cardiac conduction disease
- **LAST preparedness:** When lidocaine infusion is combined with surgeon infiltration, cumulative LA burden must be tracked and lipid emulsion must be immediately available

**Clinical Pearl:** Lidocaine infusion is occasionally used as an adjunct in Protocol 3 for additional systemic analgesia, but it adds complexity and toxicity risk. When opioids are already being used, the marginal benefit may not justify the added monitoring burden in many cases.

### 5.4 Hemodynamic Management

- Target MAP ≥65 mmHg (individualize for CAD/cerebrovascular disease)
- Vasopressor strategy per institutional practice; avoid using opioids as primary hemodynamic “blunting” tool

### 5.5 Monitoring

- Standard ASA monitors + temperature
- Agent analyzer if volatile used
- Quantitative TOF monitoring
- Consider processed EEG in elderly/high-risk cases; interpret cautiously with ketamine

---

## 6. Emergence

### 6.1 Pre-Emergence Planning (10–30 Minutes Before End)

- Begin **fentanyl infusion taper**; stop ~20–30 minutes before extubation (phenotype-dependent)
- Discontinue adjunct infusions near closure (dexmedetomidine/ketamine/lidocaine) per workflow
- Reassess ventilation readiness (OSA/elderly/frail require stricter guardrails)

### 6.2 Hypnotic Reduction

- Taper propofol and/or sevoflurane gradually toward emergence dosing
- Avoid abrupt cessation with residual stimulation

### 6.3 Reversal + PONV Prophylaxis

- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** (opioid-inclusive pathway: higher baseline PONV risk)
- Neuromuscular reversal per TOF depth and institutional policy
- **Verify TOF ratio ≥0.9 before extubation (mandatory)**

**Multimodal PONV Prophylaxis:**

Opioid-inclusive pathways carry higher baseline PONV risk. For high-risk patients (Apfel score ≥3):
- Use **multimodal PONV prophylaxis** per institutional policy
- Typical regimen: Dexamethasone (preop) + 5-HT₃ antagonist (ondansetron at emergence) ± scopolamine patch ± antidopaminergic agent (droperidol/haloperidol where permitted)
- **Do NOT rely on single-agent prophylaxis** in Apfel ≥3 phenotypes with opioid exposure

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria (More Stringent With Opioids)

- Awake or easily arousable; follows commands; minimal sedation
- Adequate ventilation and oxygenation
- TOF ratio ≥0.9
- Hemodynamic stability

**Clinical pearl:** maintain a low threshold to delay extubation if somnolent or hypoventilating, especially in OSA/elderly/frail or opioid-naïve patients.

---

## 7. Postoperative Pain Management

- Continue multimodal foundation (acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 if safe)
- Continue baseline home opioids for chronic opioid users with bowel regimen and monitoring
- PACU rescue opioids per institutional policy in small increments with reassessment
- Anticipate higher PONV risk; treat proactively with multimodal antiemetics

---

## 8. Safety Monitoring

- Continuous SpO₂ in PACU; consider **capnography** in high-risk phenotypes (OSA, obesity, elderly, high opioid exposure)
- Sedation assessments (e.g., RASS) with escalation pathways for oversedation/hypoventilation
- Early mobilization when alert (RASS ~0), pain controlled, hemodynamically stable, and PONV controlled

### 8.1 High-Risk Phenotype Monitoring Escalation

**For patients receiving intraoperative opioids with high-risk phenotypes:**

| Risk Factor | Monitoring Escalation | Institutional Criteria |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | Continuous pulse oximetry overnight; consider capnography in PACU | Follow institutional OSA monitoring protocol |
| **Elderly (>75) or frail** | Enhanced sedation scoring (RASS q2h); lower threshold for monitored bed | Consult with PACU/floor attending |
| **Opioid-naïve with high exposure** | Continuous pulse oximetry until fully alert and stable; frequent respiratory rate assessment | Per institutional opioid monitoring policy |
| **Recurrent desaturation** | Escalate to monitored bed; consider capnography; respiratory therapy consult | Do NOT discharge to unmonitored floor bed |
| **Oversedation (RASS -2 or lower)** | Reduce/hold opioids; consider naloxone if respiratory compromise; escalate monitoring | Notify attending; consider ICU if severe |
| **Naloxone requirement** | **Mandatory escalation to monitored bed**; continuous monitoring; incident reporting | Follow institutional critical event protocol |

**General Principle:** Follow institutional criteria for continuous oximetry and escalation to monitored bed. When in doubt, err on side of enhanced monitoring rather than assuming stability.

**Documentation Requirement:** When Protocol 3 is used in high-risk phenotypes, document:
- [ ] Risk factors identified (OSA/elderly/frail/opioid-naïve)
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring plan implemented
- [ ] Postoperative monitoring location (PACU → floor vs monitored bed)
- [ ] Any special precautions or escalation criteria discussed with receiving team

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Contributors | First-Line Actions |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Somnolence/hypoventilation** | Opioid stacking; residual anesthetic; OSA | Stimulate, airway positioning, supplemental O₂, consider capnography, reduce/avoid further opioids, escalate monitoring |
| **PONV** | Opioid exposure; risk phenotype | Multimodal antiemetics per policy; minimize opioid rescue when feasible |
| **Inadequate analgesia** | Insufficient regional/LIA; opioid tolerance | Optimize non-opioid multimodal; reassess for blocks/LIA efficacy; titrate rescue carefully |
| **Delayed emergence** | Excess hypnotic; late opioids; adjunct stacking | Reduce hypnotics, avoid further opioids, reassess TOF, check metabolic causes |

---

## 10. Clinical Pearls

1. **Infusion-based opioid strategy improves emergence predictability** compared with repeated boluses, when paired with deliberate tapering.
2. **Avoid late-case opioid stacking**; phenotype-specific tapering is a core safety control.
3. **OSA/elderly/frail phenotypes require stricter extubation criteria** and enhanced PACU monitoring.
4. **Regional analgesia remains beneficial when safe** and can reduce postoperative opioid exposure even in Protocol 3.
5. **Treat PONV proactively**; opioid-inclusive pathways have higher baseline risk.

## Appendix B: Patient Information Sheet

### What is Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia)?

**For patients and families:**

Protocol 3 is a conventional anesthesia approach that includes opioids during surgery to manage pain. It is sometimes used when opioid-free pathways are not appropriate (for example, if a patient takes opioids chronically) or when a conventional approach is preferred after discussion.

**Before Surgery:**
- You will receive scheduled non-opioid pain medications (acetaminophen and an anti-inflammatory if safe)
- Your anesthesiology team will review your medical history and any home opioid use
- Your surgeon may inject numbing medicine around the knee during surgery

**During Surgery:**
- You will be completely asleep and will not feel anything
- Along with anesthetic medications, opioids may be given (often as a controlled infusion) to manage surgical pain

**After Surgery:**
- Pain control may be more variable than with opioid-free pathways
- **Some patients may still experience moderate pain despite opioid use** - this is not unusual and does not mean the anesthetic failed
- You may have more nausea or sleepiness than patients receiving opioid-free anesthesia
- If you have sleep apnea, breathing sensitivity, or certain other conditions, your care team will monitor you more closely
- Your nurses will work with you to manage pain, nausea, and other symptoms safely
- Walking and early movement help with recovery, though sedation or nausea may delay this slightly compared to opioid-free approaches

**Benefits:**
- Familiar, conventional approach
- Often appropriate for patients with chronic opioid use or high opioid tolerance

**Risks (compared with opioid-sparing approaches):**
- Higher risk of nausea/vomiting and sedation
- Higher risk of breathing-related complications in sleep apnea or opioid-sensitive patients

**Questions?**
Ask your anesthesiologist or surgeon for more information.

- [ ] Infusion pumps for propofol and opioid infusion strategies (e.g., fentanyl)
- [ ] Capnography available in PACU for high-risk monitoring
- [ ] Airway rescue equipment and protocols readily available

**Pharmacy:**
- [ ] Fentanyl infusion capability (premix availability or preparation workflow)
- [ ] Hydromorphone available for carefully titrated rescue dosing
- [ ] Multimodal foundation agents (acetaminophen, NSAIDs/COX-2 if appropriate, dexamethasone, ondansetron)
- [ ] Sugammadex available in OR and PACU per institutional policy
- [ ] Lipid emulsion 20% available where local anesthetic techniques are performed (if blocks/LIA are used)

**Protocols and Policies:**
- [ ] Standard postoperative monitoring protocols for opioid-exposed patients (OSA, obesity, elderly)
- [ ] PACU pain management and PONV protocols aligned with opioid-inclusive pathway
- [ ] Multimodal analgesia order sets created (scheduled acetaminophen/NSAID when appropriate)
- [ ] Clear escalation pathways for hypoventilation, oversedation, and refractory PONV

**Quality Metrics:**
- [ ] Pain scores tracked (NRS at arrival, 1h, 2h, discharge)
- [ ] Opioid consumption tracked (MME in PACU, first 24h)
- [ ] PONV incidence tracked
- [ ] Time to mobilization tracked
- [ ] Adverse events tracked (respiratory depression, naloxone use, unplanned admission, delayed discharge)

**Governance:**
- [ ] Anesthesia department leadership approval
- [ ] Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee approval
- [ ] Surgical leadership approval and engagement
- [ ] Nursing leadership (PACU, floor) approval and training
- [ ] Quality/patient safety committee review
- [ ] IRB approval if data collection for research

### Pilot Phase Recommendations

1. **Start small:** 10–20 patients with experienced attending supervision
2. **Collect data:** pain, opioid use, PONV, respiratory events, mobilization, satisfaction
3. **Debrief regularly:** weekly case review for opioid taper timing and rescue patterns
4. **Iterate:** adjust infusion ranges/taper timing for phenotype-specific safety
5. **Scale gradually:** expand as workflow and monitoring systems mature

## Document Version Control

**Version:** 1.4  
**Last Updated:** December 14, 2025  
**Next Scheduled Review:** June 2026 or upon major guideline updates

**Alignment:** Protocol Comparison Table v2.1 (December 14, 2025)

**Major Changes from v1.3:**
- Clarified Protocol 3 positioning as third-line / non-default ERAS pathway
- Standardized opioid delivery as infusion-based fentanyl strategy with deliberate tapering (vs PRN bolus framing)
- Reinforced extubation and PACU monitoring guardrails for opioid-exposed phenotypes (OSA/elderly/frail)
- Harmonized structure with Protocol 1/2 (quick reference, TOC, appendices, governance, version control)

**Revision History:**
- Version 1.0 (November 2025): Initial protocol framework
- Version 1.1–1.3 (November–December 2025): Iterative refinements
- Version 1.4 (December 14, 2025): Cohesion update to align with Protocol Comparison Table v2.1 and Protocol 1/2 formatting

**Governance Statement:**  
This document is an educational clinical framework intended to support structured decision-making. It does not supersede institutional policy, order sets, anticoagulation tables, or attending anesthesiologist judgment. When conflicts arise, local governance and patient-specific risk assessment prevail.

# Protocol 3 – Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia (rTKA)

Conventional, **opioid-inclusive** general anesthetic framework for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). This pathway is **not intended as the default ERAS strategy**; when feasible, **OFIA-based pathways (with or without blocks)** are generally preferred for opioid-naïve patients and ERAS optimization.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS guidance, ASA/APSF safety recommendations, and ASRA regional anesthesia/anticoagulation standards but **do not replace** institutional policy, credentialing, or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized.
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.
> - Elderly/frail, OSA, significant cardiopulmonary disease, advanced renal/hepatic impairment, and extremes of BMI require additional modification.

---

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway describes a **conventional opioid-inclusive general anesthetic** for rTKA and is generally **reserved for**:

- **Chronic opioid users** or high opioid tolerance (document baseline regimen and estimated MME/day).
- Patients who **request** a conventional opioid-based anesthetic after balanced counseling.
- Situations where core OFIA components are **contraindicated or discouraged**, for example:
  - Active psychosis (ketamine generally avoided).
  - Advanced AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided).
  - Severe renal impairment where certain adjuncts (e.g., magnesium) are not desired/appropriate.
- Cases where attending/institutional workflow strongly favors a conventional approach after shared decision-making and documentation.

> **Key principle:** This pathway is **not first-line** for ERAS; it is used when OFIA-based pathways are inappropriate, not desired, or not feasible.

---

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment
- Full history and physical:
  - ASA classification, airway exam, functional capacity (METs), allergies.
- **Opioid history (required):**
  - Baseline opioid regimen (drug, dose, route, schedule, estimated MME/day).
  - Prior perioperative analgesic responses and adverse effects.
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV risk, delirium/cognitive baseline, frailty (especially >70–80), OSA screening (STOP-Bang) and home CPAP/BiPAP use.
- Anticoagulation:
  - If regional blocks are considered, confirm against **ASRA timing** and local policy.

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed; Individualize)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV** (30–60 min pre-op; adjust for liver disease/low body weight).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hr pre-op; or institutional NSAID alternative if appropriate).
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** after IV placement (monitor glucose in diabetics).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** for high PONV-risk patients without contraindication.
- **Midazolam 0.5–2 mg IV** preop anxiolysis (use **≤1 mg** in elderly/frail/OSA; avoid if high delirium risk when feasible).
- **Continue baseline home opioids** morning of surgery for chronic opioid users per attending/pain service guidance.
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** unless a specific indication exists per institutional policy.

### 2.3 Regional Blocks (Optional but Often Beneficial)
Consider **ACB + IPACK** even in an opioid-inclusive anesthetic when not contraindicated:
- Can reduce perioperative opioid exposure and improve early mobility.
- If performed:
  - Follow ASRA anticoagulation timing and local policy.
  - Ensure **LAST preparedness** (20% lipid emulsion immediately available).
  - Use technique/dosing from Protocol 1 as the reference standard.

---

## 3. Ketamine Guardrails (If Used as Adjunct)

Ketamine is **optional** and should be treated as a **sub-anesthetic adjunct** (not a default primary induction agent).

Use caution, reduce dose, or omit when:
- Hemodynamic instability or escalating vasopressor requirement; suspected catecholamine-depleted physiology.
- Frailty / advanced age with limited physiologic reserve.
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk or contexts where sympathetic stimulation is undesirable.
- Active psychosis or unstable severe psychiatric disease (context-dependent).

**BIS/EEG caveat:** ketamine can increase BIS and alter EEG-derived indices without reflecting inadequate hypnosis. Avoid titrating hypnotics to BIS alone after ketamine; correlate clinically and with raw EEG when available.

---

## 4. Induction

> Doses are typical adult ranges; reduce in frail/elderly/hemodynamically limited patients.

### 4.1 Pre-oxygenation
- 100% FiO₂ by tight mask for **3–5 minutes**.

### 4.2 Induction Sequence (Illustrative)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (primary hypnotic; consider 1–1.5 mg/kg in frail/cardiac patients).
- **Fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg IV** (opioid component; titrate to physiology and expected stimulation).
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** with TOF monitoring.
- **Midazolam 0–0.5 mg IV** only if needed (often omit if adequate preop anxiolysis already given).
- Optional (selection-dependent): **Ketamine 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV** adjunct (apply guardrails).

### 4.3 Airway Management
- ETT vs LMA based on aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, surgical requirements, positioning.
- Confirm placement with continuous ETCO₂ waveform; document airway grade/adjuncts used.

---

## 5. Maintenance

### 5.1 Primary Maintenance (Propofol-First Backbone)
**Default hypnotic backbone:**
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to physiology and depth targets)

**Optional/additive volatile strategy (workflow-dependent):**
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)** may be used as an additive/hybrid or per attending workflow.

> Practical framing: **Propofol is explicitly present as the primary hypnotic backbone; sevoflurane is optional and workflow-dependent.**

### 5.2 Opioid Management (Intraoperative — Continuous Infusion Standard)
Goal: stable analgesia while minimizing peak/trough and avoiding late-case opioid stacking.

**Fentanyl infusion (preferred in this repository for Protocol 3):**
- Start **0.5–2.0 mcg/kg/hr IV infusion** (typical starting range: **~0.5–1.0 mcg/kg/hr**)
- Titrate by stimulation, hemodynamics, and patient phenotype:
  - Chronic opioid user / high tolerance: may require higher end of range
  - Elderly/frail/OSA: favor lower end and earlier taper
- **Taper/stop 20–30 minutes before planned emergence** (adjust for total exposure and respiratory-risk phenotype)

**Hydromorphone supplementation (optional, end-of-case planning):**
- **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.6 mg IV** total, titrated in small increments with reassessment
- Use conservatively in elderly/OSA/frail; avoid stacking close to extubation

> **Avoid “boluses PRN” framing** in this protocol: opioid delivery is designed as a **continuous fentanyl infusion** with deliberate tapering and explicit emergence planning.

### 5.3 Optional Adjuncts (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (optional; dose-reduce in elderly/frail; monitor bradycardia/hypotension).
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr** (optional; generally favored for opioid tolerance rather than routine use; apply guardrails).
- **Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr** optional per institutional policy; respect contraindications/total dose ceilings; monitor for toxicity.

### 5.4 Hemodynamic Management
- Target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (individualize for CAD/cerebrovascular disease).
- Vasopressor strategy per institutional practice:
  - Phenylephrine for hypotension with adequate HR
  - Ephedrine for hypotension with relative bradycardia
- Avoid using opioids as the primary hemodynamic “blunting” tool at the expense of delayed emergence/respiratory risk.

### 5.5 Monitoring
- Standard ASA monitors + temperature.
- Agent analyzer if volatile used.
- Neuromuscular monitoring (TOF).
- Consider brain function monitoring (BIS/EEG) in elderly or high-risk cases; interpret cautiously if ketamine used.

---

## 6. Emergence

### 6.1 Late Intraoperative Period (Planning Phase)
- **Taper fentanyl infusion** with explicit timing (typically begin taper in last 30 minutes; stop ~20–30 minutes pre-extubation, phenotype-dependent).
- Discontinue adjunct infusions (dexmedetomidine/ketamine/lidocaine) per workflow, typically near closure.
- Reassess sedation/ventilation readiness, especially in OSA/elderly/frail patients.

### 6.2 At Skin Closure
- Taper hypnotics for emergence:
  - Reduce propofol infusion and/or taper sevoflurane if used.

### 6.3 Reversal + PONV Prophylaxis
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** (opioid pathways carry higher PONV risk).
- **Sugammadex** per blockade depth and institutional policy (dose per TOF metrics).

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria (More Stringent With Opioids)
- Awake or easily arousable; following commands; minimal sedation.
- Adequate ventilation/oxygenation with acceptable mechanics.
- Objective neuromuscular recovery (TOF ratio ≥0.9).
- Hemodynamically stable.

Clinical pearl: maintain a **low threshold to delay extubation** if somnolent or hypoventilating—especially in OSA, elderly, or opioid-naïve patients.

### 6.5 Immediate PACU Monitoring
- Continuous SpO₂ monitoring is standard.
- Consider capnography in high-risk phenotypes (OSA, obesity, elderly, high opioid exposure).

---

## 7. Postoperative Analgesia and Recovery

### 7.1 Expected Pain Profile (Trends)
- Without blocks: early pain commonly higher and more variable.
- With ACB/IPACK: early pain often lower with reduced rescue opioid needs.
- Opioid pathway patients demonstrate higher risk of PONV and respiratory depression, particularly in OSA/elderly.

### 7.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia
- Acetaminophen + NSAID (if safe) remain foundational.
- Continue baseline home opioids for chronic opioid users with bowel regimen and appropriate monitoring.

### 7.3 PACU Rescue (Titrate Carefully)
- Opioid rescue per institutional policy (e.g., **hydromorphone 0.1–0.2 mg IV** increments with reassessment).
- Escalate monitoring intensity in high-risk phenotypes (OSA, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, high total opioid exposure).

### 7.4 Mobilization
- Mobilize when alert (RASS ~0), pain controlled, hemodynamically stable, and PONV controlled.
- Opioid-related sedation/PONV may delay early mobility relative to OFIA pathways.

---

## 8. Summary and Key Principles

- Protocol 3 is generally reserved for chronic opioid use, OFIA contraindications, or strong preference after counseling.
- **Propofol is the default hypnotic backbone** for induction and maintenance in this framework.
- **Sevoflurane is optional/additive** depending on workflow and attending preference.
- **Fentanyl is delivered as a continuous infusion** with deliberate tapering (not bolus-driven PRN dosing).
- Regional analgesia (ACB/IPACK) remains beneficial when safe and feasible, even in opioid-inclusive anesthetics.
- Respiratory depression and delirium risk warrant conservative dosing and enhanced monitoring in OSA/elderly/frail

## Appendix B: Patient Information Sheet

### What is Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia)?

**For patients and families:**

Protocol 3 is a conventional anesthesia approach that includes opioids during surgery to manage pain. It is sometimes used when opioid-free pathways are not appropriate (for example, if a patient takes opioids chronically) or when a conventional approach is preferred after discussion.

**Before Surgery:**
- You will receive scheduled non-opioid pain medications (acetaminophen and an anti-inflammatory if safe)
- Your anesthesiology team will review your medical history and any home opioid use
- Your surgeon may inject numbing medicine around the knee during surgery

**During Surgery:**
- You will be completely asleep and will not feel anything
- Along with anesthetic medications, opioids may be given (often as a controlled infusion) to manage surgical pain

**After Surgery:**
- Pain may be more variable than in opioid-free pathways
- Some patients may have more nausea, sleepiness, or breathing sensitivity, especially if they have sleep apnea
- Your care team will monitor you closely and provide medications to prevent nausea and manage pain safely

**Benefits:**
- Familiar, conventional approach
- Often appropriate for patients with chronic opioid use or high opioid tolerance

**Risks (compared with opioid-sparing approaches):**
- Higher risk of nausea/vomiting and sedation
- Higher risk of breathing-related complications in sleep apnea or opioid-sensitive patients

**Questions?**
Ask your anesthesiologist or surgeon for more information.

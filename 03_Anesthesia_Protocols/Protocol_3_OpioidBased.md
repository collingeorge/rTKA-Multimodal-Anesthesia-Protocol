# Conventional Opioid-Inclusive Anesthesia

## 1. Purpose
Traditional anesthesia pathway for:
- **Chronic opioid users** (>30 MME/day for >3 months)
- Patients requesting conventional anesthesia after counseling
- Severe anxiety disorders unresponsive to standard anxiolysis
- Cases where OFIA agents are contraindicated:
  - Active psychosis (ketamine contraindicated)
  - High-degree AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine contraindicated)
  - Severe renal impairment CrCl <30 (magnesium contraindicated)
- Patient or attending preference after shared decision-making

---

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### Patient Assessment
- ASA classification, airway exam, METs, allergies
- **Document baseline opioid use** (type, dose, MME/day)
- Review PONV/delirium history (higher risk with opioids)
- Frailty/cognition assessment for elderly
- OSA screening (STOP-Bang score) - enhanced monitoring needed
- Anticoagulation status if considering blocks

### Medications (ERAS-aligned)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (give 30-60 min pre-op)
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (give 1-2 hours pre-op; if no contraindication - check renal function, cardiovascular risk)
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** (give after IV placement; PONV prophylaxis + analgesic synergy)
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** (evening prior or ≥2 hrs pre-op for high PONV risk)
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** (preoperative anxiolysis in holding area)
- Continue home opioid dose morning of surgery for chronic users
- **Avoid gabapentinoids** (ASA/APSF 2024)

### Regional Blocks (Optional but Recommended)
Consider ACB + IPACK even with opioid-based anesthesia:
- Significantly reduces intra-op and post-op opioid requirements
- Improves analgesia quality and early mobilization
- Check ASRA 2024-2025 anticoagulation timing if performing blocks
- If blocks done: follow Protocol 1 block technique

## 3. Induction

**Pre-Oxygenation:**
- 100% FiO2 via tight-fitting mask for 3-5 minutes

**Induction Sequence:**
- **Midazolam 0.5–1 mg IV** (additional if needed; already received 1-2 mg preop)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (induction agent)
- **Fentanyl 1–2 mcg/kg IV** (typical 75-150 mcg for 70 kg patient)
  - OR **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV** (longer duration, more potent)
  - **Opioid-tolerant patients:** May require 2-3x usual dose
- **Optional: Ketamine 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV** (for opioid-tolerant patients - improves analgesia, reduces tolerance)
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** (neuromuscular blockade)

**Airway Management:**
- Endotracheal intubation or LMA per clinical judgment
- Confirm ETCO2 waveform
- Secure airway device

---

## 4. Maintenance

**Anesthetic Maintenance (Choose One):**
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** (preferred for ease of titration, hemodynamic stability)
  - OR
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (preferred for high PONV risk or MH susceptibility)

**Opioid Management:**
- **Fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV boluses PRN** for hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation
  - Typical total: 200-400 mcg for 70 kg patient
  - **Opioid-tolerant:** May require 500-1000+ mcg total
- **Alternative: Hydromorphone 0.2-0.4 mg IV boluses PRN**
- **Remifentanil infusion 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/min** (if TIVA with propofol)

**Optional Adjuncts (Consider for Opioid Tolerance):**
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr** (NMDA antagonism, reduces opioid tolerance)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (opioid-sparing, sedation synergy; lower dose range due to opioid CNS depression)
- **Lidocaine infusion 1 mg/kg/hr** (additional analgesic component)

**Hemodynamic Management:**
- **Maintain MAP >65 mmHg**
- Balance opioid dosing with hemodynamic stability
- Avoid excessive opioid causing bradycardia/hypotension

**Monitoring:**
- Standard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP, SpO2, ETCO2, temperature)
- Neuromuscular monitoring (TOF)
- Consider BIS/depth monitoring (opioids don't suppress BIS as much as volatiles)

---

## 5. Emergence

**Before Skin Closure:**
- Assess total opioid administered
- Consider timing of last opioid dose (avoid bolus within 15 min of extubation if possible)

**Before Extubation:**
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** (PONV prophylaxis - critical with opioids)
- **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV** if TOF shows residual blockade (or 4 mg/kg for deep block)
- Consider additional antiemetic if high PONV risk

**Extubation Criteria (More Stringent with Opioids):**
- **Fully awake**, following commands, protecting airway
- **Adequate spontaneous ventilation:**
  - Tidal volume >5 mL/kg
  - Respiratory rate 10-20 bpm (watch for opioid-induced bradypnea)
  - SpO2 >92% on room air or minimal O2
- **TOF ratio >0.9**
- **Hemodynamically stable**

**Post-Extubation Monitoring:**
- **Continuous pulse oximetry mandatory**
- **Consider capnography** for high-risk patients (OSA, elderly, high opioid dose)
- Monitor closely for:
  - **Sedation** (RASS score, arousability)
  - **Respiratory depression** (RR <10, SpO2 <90%, inadequate TV)
  - **PONV** (treat proactively)

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia

### Expected PACU Pain Scores
- **NRS 2–6/10** (variable depending on blocks)
- If blocks performed: expect NRS 0-3
- If no blocks: expect NRS 3-6
- Higher sedation and PONV than OFIA pathways

### Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia (Continue from Preop)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h** (max 4 g/day)
- **NSAID of choice:**
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h, OR
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day, limit 48-72h), OR
  - Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily
- **Continue home opioids** at baseline dose for chronic users

### Opioid Rescue (Titrate Carefully)
**IV (PACU):**
- **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10-15 min PRN** for NRS ≥4
- Reassess pain, sedation, respiratory status after EACH dose
- **Maximum cumulative dose per protocol** (e.g., 2 mg/4 hours)
- **Opioid-tolerant patients** may require higher doses

**PO (Floor):**
- **Oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO q4–6h PRN** (immediate release)
  - OR oxycodone 10-15 mg PO q12h (extended release) + immediate release for breakthrough
- **Opioid-tolerant:** Resume home opioid regimen + additional PRN dosing

### Safety Monitoring
- **Naloxone 0.4 mg IV readily available** at bedside
  - Indications: RR <8, SpO2 <85% despite stimulation, unresponsive
- **Enhanced monitoring** if:
  - OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)
  - Elderly (>70 years)
  - Opioid-naïve receiving opioids
  - Total intraoperative opioid >300 mcg fentanyl equivalents
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** for high-risk patients
- **Consider capnography** overnight for very high-risk patients

### Non-Pharmacologic Measures
- Ice application to surgical site
- Limb elevation and positioning
- Early mobilization when safe (reduces ileus, improves recovery)

---

## 7. Notes

### Clinical Considerations
- **Higher PONV risk** (30-40% incidence vs <10% with OFIA)
- **Higher sedation risk** requiring extended PACU monitoring
- **Respiratory depression risk** especially in OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve
- **Delayed mobilization** compared to OFIA pathways (sedation, PONV)
- **Use only when clinically indicated** - not first-line for ERAS

### Advantages
- **Familiar technique** for practitioners
- **Predictable hemodynamics** with opioid-based anesthesia
- **Appropriate for chronic opioid users** who require continued therapy
- **Established rescue protocols** widely understood by PACU staff

### Key Principles
- **Midazolam provides anxiolysis** and does not interfere with opioid-based anesthesia
- **Propofol and sevoflurane equally valid** based on patient factors (PONV risk, MH, preference)
- **Multimodal analgesia still essential** - opioids are ONE component, not sole strategy
- **Regional blocks strongly recommended** even with opioid anesthesia - significantly improves outcomes
- **Monitor aggressively** for respiratory depression and PONV
- **Transition to oral multimodal** as soon as tolerated to minimize IV opioid use

### When to Choose This Pathway
- **Chronic opioid use** (>30 MME/day baseline)
- **OFIA contraindications** (psychosis, AV block, severe renal disease)
- **Patient preference** after counseling on risks/benefits
- **Severe anxiety** unresponsive to midazolam alone
- **Practitioner preference** with attending-level decision-making

### Comparison to OFIA Pathways
- **Pain control:** Similar if blocks used, inferior if no blocks
- **PONV:** 3-4x higher incidence (30-40% vs <10%)
- **Sedation:** Significantly higher, longer PACU stay
- **Mobilization:** Often delayed to POD 1 vs POD 0 for OFIA
- **Delirium risk:** Higher in elderly (opioid-related)
- **Respiratory complications:** Higher risk requiring enhanced monitoring

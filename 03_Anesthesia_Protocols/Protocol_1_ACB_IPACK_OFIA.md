# Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) With ACB + IPACK  
**Protocol 1 – Preferred First-Line rTKA Pathway**

---

## 1. Purpose
Provide a standardized **first-line** opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) using **adductor canal block (ACB)** and **IPACK**. This protocol optimizes analgesia, minimizes opioid exposure, reduces PONV, preserves quadriceps strength, and supports ERAS goals including **POD 0 ambulation**.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS 2024, ASA/APSF 2024, and ASRA 2024–2025 but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses represent **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized.  
> - Pathway selection remains **attending-dependent**.  
> - Frail, elderly, OSA, cardiac, or renal/hepatic-impaired patients require tailored dosing.  
> - This protocol intentionally uses **conservative guardrails** to reduce misuse risk.

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment
- Standard preanesthetic evaluation  
- Review prior anesthesia records  
- Identify risk factors for PONV, delirium, OSA, frailty  
- Opioid tolerance assessment  
- **Confirm suitability for peripheral nerve blocks**  
- **Screen for ketamine caution contexts** (see Section 4.2): frailty/advanced age, hemodynamic instability, tachyarrhythmia risk, catecholamine-depleted physiology, severe psychiatric disease

**ASRA 2024–2025 anticoagulation compliance (confirm local policy):**
- **DOACs:** ≥72h if CrCl >50 mL/min (longer if impaired)  
- **Warfarin:** INR ≤1.4  
- **Prophylactic LMWH:** ≥12h  
- **Therapeutic LMWH:** ≥24h  
- **Aspirin/NSAIDs:** typically no hold required for peripheral blocks per ASRA  
- **Clopidogrel:** institution-specific; follow local policy for peripheral blocks  

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op)  
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hours pre-op; meloxicam 15 mg alternative)  
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** after IV placement  
- **Scopolamine patch 1.5 mg** for *high PONV risk only*  
- **Avoid gabapentinoids** (ASA/APSF safety framing; sedation/delirium/respiratory depression risk in select populations)  
- *Midazolam is reserved for block placement anxiolysis (below).*

---

## 3. Regional Blocks (Ultrasound-Guided – Essential for Protocol 1)

### 3.1 Pre-Block Anxiolysis
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV**  
  - Use **0.5–1 mg** in elderly/OSA/frail  
  - Avoid oversedation prior to induction  
  - Consider avoiding additional midazolam at induction if adequate anxiolysis already achieved

### 3.2 Adductor Canal Block (ACB)
- **20–30 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%** (commonly 25 mL)  
- Subsartorial approach targeting the vastoadductor canal  
- Incremental injection, negative aspiration, visual spread confirmed  

### 3.3 IPACK Block
- **~20 mL ropivacaine 0.2–0.25%**  
- Ultrasound-guided between posterior capsule and popliteal artery  
- Avoid intravascular or intraneural injection; incremental dosing  

### 3.4 Documentation
- Total ropivacaine dose (mg)  
- Typical maximum dose reference: **~3 mg/kg** (institution-dependent)  
- Block type, laterality, volume, concentration, patient tolerance  
- Block quality (excellent/good/fair/poor)  
- Confirmation that quadriceps strength is preserved (motor-sparing intent)

### 3.5 Safety
- **Lipid emulsion 20% immediately available**  
- Standard LAST precautions, monitoring, and response pathway accessible in block area

---

## 4. Induction

> Doses apply to typical adults; reduce for frail, elderly, or hemodynamically unstable patients.

### 4.1 Induction Sequence (Propofol-Based)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (**primary hypnotic**)  
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
- **Midazolam 0–0.5 mg IV** *only if needed* (often omit if already given for blocks; dose-reduce elderly/frail)

### 4.2 Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct — Not Default Induction Agent)
Ketamine may be used as a **sub-anesthetic adjunct** for opioid-sparing analgesia and antihyperalgesia.

**Dose (if used):**
- **Ketamine 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (titrate to effect; **lower end favored** in elderly/frail or hemodynamically fragile patients)

**Use caution / reduce dose / omit** ketamine when:
- **Hemodynamic instability** or escalating vasopressor requirement; suspected catecholamine-depleted physiology  
- **Frailty / advanced age** with limited physiologic reserve (higher delirium/prolonged recovery risk)  
- Significant **tachyarrhythmia risk** or contexts where sympathetic stimulation is undesirable  
- Severe psychiatric disease with active psychosis (context-dependent)

**BIS/EEG caveat:** ketamine can increase BIS and alter EEG-derived indices. Avoid titrating hypnotics to BIS alone after ketamine; correlate clinically and with raw EEG trends when available.

### 4.3 Optional Adjunct Initiation (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine:** prefer **infusion without routine loading bolus** in most patients  
  - If started early: **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (lower end favored in elderly/frail; avoid bolus in fragile patients)  
- **Magnesium sulfate 30–50 mg/kg IV** over 15–20 minutes (avoid if **CrCl <30 mL/min**)

### 4.4 Airway Management
- ETT vs LMA based on risk profile and surgical factors  
- Confirm placement with ETCO₂  
- Document airway grade as applicable

---

## 5. Maintenance

### 5.1 Primary Maintenance (Propofol Default; Sevo Optional/Additive)
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (**default maintenance strategy**)  
- **Optional sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC** may be added selectively (case length/complexity, workflow, emergence strategy, institutional preference)

> The intent is to keep propofol explicitly present as the maintenance backbone while acknowledging that sevoflurane is frequently used as an adjunct in some workflows.

### 5.2 Adjuncts (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr**  
  - Use **0.2–0.4** for elderly/frail  
  - Avoid large bolus loading in hemodynamically fragile patients  
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr** *optional*  
  - Favor lower end or omit in frail/elderly or unstable patients  
- Magnesium as dosed above if selected and appropriate

### 5.3 Hemodynamic Management
- Target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (individualize for CAD/cerebrovascular disease)  
- Treat hypotension (institutional practice):
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (HR >70)  
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** (HR <60)  
- Dex-related bradycardia/hypotension:
  - Reduce/stop infusion if recurrent  
  - **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** if symptomatic (per local protocol)

### 5.4 Monitoring
- Standard ASA monitors  
- TOF neuromuscular monitoring  
- Volatile agent analyzer if sevoflurane used  
- Consider processed EEG (e.g., BIS) in elderly/frail, with ketamine caveat above

### Key Principle
**Zero intraoperative opioids** in this pathway (unless conversion required for safety).

## 6. Emergence

### 6.1 10–15 Minutes Before End
- Begin reducing dexmedetomidine (or stop as tolerated)  
- If ketamine infusion used, plan stop at closure

### 6.2 At Skin Closure
- Stop ketamine infusion (if used)  
- Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing  
- If sevoflurane used, taper toward **~0.5–0.7 MAC** as tolerated

### 6.3 Reversal + PONV Prophylaxis
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV**  
- **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg** (TOF ≥2 but <0.9)  
- **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** for deep block  

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria
- Awake, follows commands  
- RR 10–20, TV >5 mL/kg  
- SpO₂ >92%  
- TOF ratio ≥0.9  
- Hemodynamically stable  

### 6.5 Expected
- Smooth emergence  
- Low PONV incidence  
- Emergence typically within ~10–15 minutes (patient and dosing dependent)

## 7. Postoperative Phase

### 7.1 Expected Pain Profile
- **NRS 0–3** for first 12–18 hours  
- If NRS ≥4:
  - Evaluate block quality  
  - Consider tourniquet pain  
  - Rule out surgical complication  

### 7.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h** (max 4 g/day)  
- NSAID options (institutional policy):
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h  
  - OR Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h  
  - OR Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily  

### 7.3 Rescue Analgesia (Stepwise; Selection-Dependent)
1. **Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min**  
   - Max ~3 doses  
   - **Omit or reduce** in frail/elderly, unstable hemodynamics, or tachyarrhythmia risk (see guardrails)  
2. **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV**  
   - Only if inadequate response and clinically appropriate  
   - Enhanced respiratory monitoring required  

### 7.4 Mobilization
- POD 0 ambulation typically within **4–6 hours**  
- Quad-sparing block supports safe mobilization  

### 7.5 Block Duration + Transition
- ACB + IPACK duration: **~12–18 hours** (variable)  
- Ensure oral regimen in place before block wear-off  
- Anticipate increased pain needs at ~12–18 hours

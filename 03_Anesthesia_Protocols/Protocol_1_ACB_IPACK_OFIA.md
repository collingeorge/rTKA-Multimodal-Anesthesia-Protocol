## 1. Purpose and Clinical Context

### 1.1 Protocol Objectives

This protocol provides a standardized **first-line** opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) that:

- **Optimizes analgesia** through quadriceps-sparing regional techniques (ACB + IPACK)
- **Minimizes perioperative opioid exposure** (zero intraoperative opioids)
- **Reduces PONV** through opioid-sparing and propofol-based strategies
- **Preserves quadriceps strength** to enable early mobilization
- **Supports ERAS goals** including POD 0 ambulation and enhanced recovery
- **Reduces respiratory complications** compared to opioid-inclusive pathways

### 1.2 Evidence Base

This protocol is informed by:
- ERAS Society Guidelines for Hip and Knee Arthroplasty (2019, 2024 updates)
- ASA/APSF perioperative safety communications (2024)
- ASRA/ESRA regional anesthesia practice advisories (2024–2025)
- SAMBA Consensus Statement on Opioid-Free Anesthesia (2020)
- Current peer-reviewed literature on multimodal analgesia and regional techniques

**Complete evidence grading and citations:** See `../../07_References_Evidence_2024.md`

### 1.3 When to Use This Protocol

**Preferred first-line when:**
- Blocks are feasible and safe (anticoagulation timing met, no contraindications)
- Patient is opioid-naïve or opioid-sensitive
- High PONV risk
- OSA or respiratory disease (opioid-sparing critical)
- Elderly/frail (with conservative adjunct dosing)
- Patient prioritizes early mobility and recovery

**Consider alternative protocols when:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows → **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free)
- Patient refuses blocks → **Protocol 2**
- Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated → **Protocol 3** (opioid-inclusive)
- Active psychosis + severe bradycardia + renal failure → **Protocol 3**

## 3. Preoperative Phase

### 3.1 Preanesthetic Assessment

**Standard evaluation:**
- Complete history and physical examination
- Airway assessment (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck mobility)
- Review prior anesthesia records (complications, PONV, difficult airway, delirium)
- ASA physical status classification
- NPO status verification

**Risk factor identification:**
- **OSA:** STOP-Bang score
- **PONV risk:** Apfel score (female, non-smoker, hx PONV/motion sickness, postop opioids)
- **Frailty:** Clinical Frailty Scale or simple assessment (gait speed, grip strength)
- **Cognitive impairment:** Baseline mental status, prior delirium
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Functional capacity, recent stress testing, medication reconciliation

- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk (Afib with RVR, SVT history)
- Frailty or advanced age (>85 years)
- Severe psychiatric disease with active psychosis
- Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)

**If blocks not feasible:** Proceed with **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free)

### 3.3 Anticoagulation Management (ASRA/ESRA 2024–2025)

> **Critical:** ACB and IPACK are **deep peripheral nerve blocks** requiring ASRA/ESRA-consistent timing with institutional policy adherence.

**Preoperative verification checklist:**
- [ ] All anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications reconciled
- [ ] Last dose timing documented for each agent
- [ ] Renal function documented (CrCl calculation for renally cleared agents)
- [ ] Block timing verified using institutional tables aligned with ASRA/ESRA guidance
- [ ] Risk-benefit discussion documented if proceeding outside standard windows

**General ASRA/ESRA guidance (verify institutional policy):**

| Anticoagulant | Hold Before Block (Normal Renal Function) | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-------|
| **DOACs** (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) | ≥72 hours | Longer in renal impairment (96-120h) |
| **Dabigatran** | ≥72 hours | Most renally dependent; longer holds with CrCl <50 |
| **Warfarin** | Until INR ≤1.4 | Verify INR morning of procedure |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24 hours | High bleeding risk |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥12 hours | Most common regimen (enoxaparin 40 mg daily) |
| **Aspirin ≤325 mg** | **No hold required** | Acceptable per ASRA for peripheral blocks |
| **Clopidogrel** | 5–7 days | **Institutional variability**; verify local policy |
| **NSAIDs** | **No hold required** | Acceptable per ASRA for peripheral blocks |

**Postoperative restart timing:**
- See [Protocol Comparison Table - ASRA Anticoagulation Timing](../Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#asraesra-anticoagulation-timing-2024-2025)
- Typical: ≥6-12 hours after single-injection blocks
- Always verify with surgical team before restarting therapeutic anticoagulation

**If timing criteria not met:**
- **Do NOT perform blocks**
- Proceed with **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free) or **Protocol 3**
- Document reason blocks deferred
- Consider rescheduling if elective and anticoagulation not emergent

### 3.4 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed Multimodal Foundation)

**Timing: 60–90 minutes before anticipated incision**

| Medication | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | PO | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | **Contraindications:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke, aspirin allergy<br>Alternative: Meloxicam 15 mg PO |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8–10 mg | IV | After IV access obtained; reduce to 4–6 mg if diabetic (monitor glucose) |

**Additional preoperative considerations:**

| Medication | Indication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Scopolamine patch** | High PONV risk only (Apfel ≥3) | 1.5 mg transdermal | Apply evening prior or ≥4 hours preop<br>**Contraindicated:** Narrow-angle glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | Reserved for block placement | See Section 4.1 | Reduce to 0.5 mg or avoid in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | **NOT recommended** | — | Risk of sedation, delirium, respiratory depression outweighs benefit in modern multimodal protocols |
| **Home opioids** | Chronic opioid use | Baseline dose | Continue morning dose; do not escalate preoperatively |

**Documentation:**
- All preoperative medications given with timing
- Any medications held and rationale
- Allergies and adverse drug reactions verified

---

## 4. Regional Anesthesia (ACB + IPACK)

> **Regional analgesia is the foundation of Protocol 1.** These blocks provide 12–18 hours of excellent analgesia, preserve quadriceps function, and enable early mobilization.

### 4.1 Pre-Block Anxiolysis

**Midazolam dosing for block placement comfort:**

| Patient Population | Dose | Timing | Notes |
|-------------------|------|--------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 1–2 mg IV | 5–10 min before block | Titrate to mild sedation, not deep |
| **Elderly (>75)** | 0.5–1 mg IV | 5–10 min before block | Lower end preferred |
| **Frail/OSA** | 0.5 mg IV or avoid | 5–10 min before block | High risk of oversedation |
| **Cognitive impairment** | Avoid if possible | — | Paradoxical agitation risk |

**Monitoring during block placement:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Intermittent blood pressure (every 5 min)
- Verbal responsiveness maintained
- Supplemental O₂ available

**Consider omitting additional midazolam at induction** if adequate anxiolysis already achieved.

### 4.2 Ultrasound-Guided Adductor Canal Block (ACB)

**Technique:**
- **Patient position:** Supine with leg slightly externally rotated
- **Ultrasound probe:** High-frequency linear (10–15 MHz)
- **Anatomic landmarks:** Mid-thigh, subsartorial/vastoadductor canal
- **Target:** Saphenous nerve within adductor canal (between sartorius and vastus medialis)
- **Needle approach:** In-plane from lateral to medial

**Local anesthetic:**
- **Ropivacaine 0.2%, 20 mL (40 mg)**
- Incremental injection with frequent aspiration (every 3–5 mL)
- Ultrasound-confirmed spread around saphenous nerve
- Avoid intravascular injection (aspirate before each increment)

**Motor assessment:**
- **Goal:** Quadriceps motor preservation (motor-sparing block)
- **Test:** Have patient perform straight leg raise or knee extension before leaving block area
- **Expected:** Maintained quadriceps strength with sensory blockade of medial leg/knee

**Documentation:**
- Block type and laterality
- Ropivacaine concentration, volume, and total dose (mg)
- Ultrasound-confirmed spread
- Motor function verification
- Patient tolerance

### 4.3 Ultrasound-Guided IPACK Block (Infiltration Between Popliteal Artery and Capsule of Knee)

**Technique:**
- **Patient position:** Supine with leg slightly flexed
- **Ultrasound probe:** High-frequency linear (10–15 MHz)
- **Anatomic landmarks:** Posterior knee, popliteal artery and femoral condyles
- **Target:** Space between popliteal artery and posterior capsule of knee
- **Needle approach:** In-plane from lateral to medial

**Local anesthetic:**
- **Ropivacaine 0.2%, 20 mL (40 mg)**
- Incremental injection with frequent aspiration
- Ultrasound-confirmed spread in correct plane (between artery and capsule)
- Avoid intravascular or intraneural injection

**Targets:**
- Genicular nerves (posterior knee capsule innervation)
- Provides posterior knee analgesia complementing ACB

**Documentation:**
- Block type and laterality
- Ropivacaine concentration, volume, and total dose (mg)
- Ultrasound-confirmed spread
- Patient tolerance

### 4.4 Total Local Anesthetic Dose and Safety

**Total ropivacaine administered:**
- ACB: 20 mL × 0.2% = 40 mg
- IPACK: 20 mL × 0.2% = 40 mg
- **Total: 80 mg ropivacaine**

**Safety margin:**
- Conservative reference ceiling: ~3 mg/kg (~200 mg for 70 kg adult)
- Protocol 1 uses 80 mg (well below toxic threshold)
- Always document if surgeon plans periarticular infiltration (additional LA exposure)

**Why 0.2% concentration:**
- Effective analgesia with lower systemic toxicity risk than 0.25–0.5%
- Supports motor-sparing intent
- Aligns with contemporary ERAS recommendations

### 4.5 LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity) Preparedness

**Required for ALL regional blocks:**

**Immediate availability (within 3 minutes):**
- [ ] **Lipid emulsion 20%** (Intralipid or equivalent)
  - Initial bolus: 1.5 mL/kg (~100 mL for 70 kg) over 1 minute
  - Infusion: 0.25 mL/kg/min for 10 minutes
  - Repeat bolus if persistent cardiovascular collapse
- [ ] **LAST treatment protocol** visible (posted in block area)
- [ ] **Code cart** accessible
- [ ] **Team trained** in LAST recognition and management

**LAST recognition (early signs):**
- CNS: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, confusion, seizures
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia → bradycardia → arrhythmias → cardiovascular collapse

**LAST treatment algorithm:**
1. **Stop injecting** local anesthetic immediately
2. **Call for help** (announce "Local anesthetic toxicity")
3. **Airway management:** 100% O₂, support ventilation, avoid propofol if possible
4. **Seizure control:** Benzodiazepines (NOT propofol if CV unstable)
5. **Lipid emulsion therapy:** As above
6. **ACLS with modifications:** Small doses epi (≤1 mcg/kg), avoid vasopressin, avoid calcium channel blockers, avoid beta-blockers, prolonged resuscitation (>1 hour may be needed)

**Institutional LAST protocol reference:** [Insert link to institutional LAST protocol]

| **Standard adult** | 20–40 mg IV (0.5 mg/kg) | Immediately before propofol | Flush with 5 mL NS before propofol |
| **Elderly/frail** | 20 mg IV | Immediately before propofol | Optional; not required |

**Important:** This is **NOT** systemic lidocaine infusion (see Section 6.2)

#### Primary Induction: Propofol

**Propofol is the hypnotic agent for induction in Protocol 1.**

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Expected Effect |
|-------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard adult** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 30–60 seconds | LOC in 30–45 seconds |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Frail** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 90–120 seconds | LOC in 60–90 seconds; anticipate hypotension |
| **Hypovolemia suspected** | **1–1.2 mg/kg IV** | Very slow push | Aggressive vasopressor readiness |

**Critical Safety:**
- **Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension**
- **Ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue:**
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (if HR adequate)
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** (if HR <60)
  - **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** (if severe hypotension)
- Have vasopressor drawn and ready BEFORE injecting propofol
- Anticipate hypotension in elderly, frail, severe cardiac disease, hypovolemia

#### Neuromuscular Blockade

**Rocuronium for intubation:**

| Dose | Timing | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** | After LOC confirmed | Dose to **ideal body weight** in obesity |
| Typical: 50–70 mg | Immediately after propofol | Intubation conditions at 60–90 seconds |

**Critical:** TOF monitoring is **mandatory** (see Section 9.3)

#### Optional: Midazolam

**Only if needed for additional anxiolysis:**

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 0–1 mg IV | Often omitted if already dosed for blocks |
| **Elderly (>75)** | 0–0.5 mg IV | **Avoid if possible**; high delirium risk |
| **Frail/OSA** | **Avoid** | Respiratory depression risk |

**Decision point:** If midazolam 1–2 mg already given for blocks → **omit at induction**

### 5.3 Optional Adjunct Boluses

> **Adjuncts blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, but do NOT replace hypnosis.**

#### Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct)

**Indication:** Opioid-sparing analgesia, blunt intubation response

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | **0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (14–35 mg for 70 kg) | Titrate to lower end initially |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | High delirium risk |
| **Frail** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | Hemodynamic fragility |

- TOF monitoring is **essential**
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

## 6. Maintenance Anesthesia

> **Maintenance ensures continuous unconsciousness while OFIA adjuncts provide analgesia and sympatholysis.**

### 6.1 Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity

**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by propofol and/or sevoflurane.**

> **Cross-Reference:** See [Protocol Comparison Table - Maintenance Anesthesia](../Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#maintenance-anesthesia) for complete options and detailed safety profiles.

**Choose ONE of the following hypnotic strategies:**

#### Option A: Propofol TIVA (Preferred for Protocol 1)

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to depth monitors) | Antiemetic properties; precise control; MH-safe |
| **Monitoring** | Consider processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in elderly/frail | Reduces risk of excessive depth |
| **Preferred When** | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; institutional preference | Best for Protocol 1 goals |

#### Option B: Sevoflurane

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **0.7–1 MAC** (age-adjusted; see table below) | Familiar; easy titration; rapid offset |
| **Monitoring** | End-tidal agent monitoring | Standard volatile technique |
| **Preferred When** | Standard workflow; not high PONV risk; volatile-capable machine | Widely available |

**Age-Adjusted MAC Reduction for Sevoflurane:**

| Age Range | MAC Reduction | Effective MAC Range |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Age 65–75** | Reduce by ~20% | 0.56–0.8 MAC |
| **Age 75–85** | Reduce by ~30–40% | 0.42–0.7 MAC |
| **Age >85** | Reduce by ~40–50% | 0.35–0.6 MAC |

#### Option C: Balanced (Propofol + Sevoflurane)

| Component | Details | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Dosing** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + Sevoflurane 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce total dose of each |
| **Complexity** | More challenging titration | Requires experience with hybrid technique |
| **Preferred When** | Institutional preference or specific clinical scenarios | Not routine for Protocol 1 |

---

### 6.2 OFIA Adjuncts (Supplement Hypnosis - Do NOT Replace)

> **Critical Understanding:**
> - Adjuncts provide **analgesia and sympatholysis**
> - Adjuncts do **NOT** provide surgical hypnosis
> - Adjuncts allow **dose reduction** of propofol/sevoflurane while maintaining depth
> - **Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness**

#### Dexmedetomidine Infusion

**Role:** Sedation, sympatholysis, opioid-sparing analgesia (NOT primary hypnosis)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum | NO bolus loading |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Titrate to effect |
| **Stop Time** | 10–15 min before case end | 10–15 min before case end | Prevents prolonged sedation |

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Continuous HR/BP monitoring
- **Stop if HR <50 with symptoms** or **<45 regardless of symptoms**
- **Reduce or stop** if hypotension (MAP <60) unresponsive to fluids/vasopressors

**Bradycardia Management:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **Then:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **Consider:** Discontinuing dexmedetomidine if recurrent

**Contraindications:**
- High-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Severe bradycardia (HR <50 at baseline)
- Severe hypotension (MAP <60 at baseline)

#### Ketamine Infusion (Optional)

**Role:** Analgesia, dissociation, NMDA antagonism (NOT reliable unconsciousness)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr | 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or **omit** | Lower end preferred |
| **Start Time** | After induction | After induction | If bolus given at induction |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | May omit entirely in high-risk |

**BIS Monitoring Caveat:**
- Ketamine **dissociates cortical activity** and may increase BIS
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine
- Correlate with clinical context (movement, autonomic signs, raw EEG trends)

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury

#### Magnesium Sulfate Maintenance (If Loaded)

**Role:** NMDA antagonism, mild analgesia

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Maintenance Rate** | 8–10 mg/kg/hr if loading dose given |
| **Duration** | Continue until skin closure |
| **Warning** | Potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate prolonged paralysis |

**Monitoring:**
- TOF monitoring essential (see Section 9.3)
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

### 6.3 Hemodynamic Management

> **Goal:** Maintain adequate perfusion while minimizing vasopressor-induced tachycardia and hypertension.

**Target Parameters:**

| Parameter | Target | Individualization |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **MAP** | ≥65 mmHg | Higher target (70–75) for chronic HTN (baseline SBP >160) or CAD/cerebrovascular disease |
| **Heart Rate** | 50–100 bpm | Individualize based on baseline and cardiac status |
| **SpO₂** | ≥95% | ≥92% acceptable in chronic lung disease |

**Hypotension Management:**

| Clinical Scenario | First-Line | Alternative | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **MAP <65, HR adequate** | **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** | Phenylephrine infusion 20–50 mcg/min | Repeat boluses q3–5min PRN |
| **MAP <65, HR <60** | **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** | Ephedrine 5 mg q5min PRN | Mixed alpha/beta agonist |
| **Severe hypotension (MAP <50)** | **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** | Epinephrine infusion | Call for help |
| **Persistent hypotension** | Consider phenylephrine infusion | 20–50 mcg/min titrated | Severe cardiac disease |

**Dexmedetomidine-Related Bradycardia/Hypotension:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **For bradycardia:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **For hypotension:** Phenylephrine or ephedrine as above
4. **If recurrent:** Discontinue dexmedetomidine

**Hypertension Management:**

| Clinical Scenario | Management | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **SBP >180 or MAP >110** | Assess anesthetic depth first | May need more propofol/sevoflurane |
| **Persistent despite adequate depth** | Labetalol 5–10 mg IV or hydralazine 5–10 mg IV | Per institutional protocol |
| **Associated with tachycardia** | Esmolol 10–20 mg IV or labetalol | Beta-blockade preferred |

**Fluid Management:**
- Goal-directed fluid therapy preferred
- Avoid aggressive crystalloid boluses (increases third-spacing)
- Typical total: 500–1000 mL crystalloid for 90-minute case
- Replace blood loss milliliter-for-milliliter with crystalloid 1:1 or colloid as indicated

---

### 6.4 Key Principle: Zero Intraoperative Opioids

**Protocol 1 is opioid-free intraoperatively.**

**This means:**
- No fentanyl boluses during case
- No hydromorphone during case
- No remifentanil infusion during case
- Analgesia provided by: regional blocks + OFIA adjuncts + multimodal foundation

**Exception:**
If patient safety requires opioid administration (e.g., severe pain despite adequate anesthetic depth, hemodynamic instability from pain/sympathetic surge), conversion to opioid rescue is appropriate. **This does not constitute pathway failure** - it represents appropriate clinical judgment.

**Document:**
- Reason for opioid administration
- Total opioid dose given
- Patient response
- Plan for PACU monitoring (enhanced if opioid given)

---

## 7. Emergence

> **Emergence is a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning and controlled execution.**

### 7.1 Pre-Emergence Planning (10–15 Minutes Before Anticipated End)

**Goal:** Smooth, controlled emergence without prolonged sedation or delayed extubation.

**Actions:**

| Time Point | Action | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **15 min before end** | Taper or stop dexmedetomidine | Prevent prolonged sedation |
| **15 min before end** | Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing (50–75 mcg/kg/min) | Begin lightening depth |
| **10 min before end** | Plan ketamine discontinuation (if used) | Minimize dissociative effects |
| **10 min before end** | Verify TOF monitor functioning and ready | Essential for reversal timing |
| **At skin closure** | Stop ketamine infusion | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop dexmedetomidine (if not already) | — |

**Communication:**
- Inform surgical team of anticipated emergence timing
- Confirm no additional procedures planned
- Verify dressing application plan

### 7.2 Hypnotic Reduction

**Propofol TIVA:**
- Taper to 25–50 mcg/kg/min at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Sevoflurane:**
- Reduce to 0.4–0.6 MAC at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Do NOT:**
- Abruptly stop hypnotic before patient ready to emerge
- Rely on adjuncts alone (dexmedetomidine is NOT sufficient for unconsciousness)

### 7.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

#### Ondansetron

**Timing:** Before emergence or at skin closure

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **All patients** | **4 mg IV** | If not already given preoperatively |
| **High PONV risk** | 4 mg IV (in addition to scopolamine patch) | May repeat 4 mg in PACU if needed |

#### Neuromuscular Reversal

> **Critical:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 is **MANDATORY** before extubation. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a patient safety risk.

**Sugammadex Dosing:**

| TOF Status | Dose | Wait Time | Expected Outcome |
|------------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **TOF count ≥2, ratio <0.9** | **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF ratio ≥0.9 |
| **Deep block (TOF 1–2)** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF count ≥2, then reassess |
| **Post-tetanic count only** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | May require additional time |

**After sugammadex administration:**
1. Wait 2–3 minutes
2. Reassess TOF ratio
3. **Confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9** before proceeding to extubation
4. If TOF <0.9 → wait longer or consider additional sugammadex (consult attending)

**Special Considerations:**
- **Magnesium potentiates NMB:** May need higher sugammadex dose or longer wait time
- **Obesity:** Dose sugammadex to **total body weight** (not IBW)
- **Renal impairment:** Sugammadex elimination prolonged; monitor closely

### 7.4 Extubation Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met before extubation:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Target |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Consciousness** | Patient opens eyes to command, squeezes hand | Awake and follows commands |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Count breaths over 15 seconds | 10–20 breaths/min |
| **Tidal Volume** | Observe chest rise or measure with spirometry | ≥5 mL/kg (≥350 mL for 70 kg) |
| **Oxygenation** | Pulse oximetry | SpO₂ ≥95% on 100% O₂ (≥92% if chronic lung disease) |
| **Neuromuscular Function** | TOF monitoring | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 (mandatory)** |
| **Hemodynamics** | Continuous monitoring | MAP ≥65 mmHg or near baseline |
| **No Active Bleeding** | Surgical team confirmation | No ongoing hemorrhage or concern |

**Additional Clinical Assessment:**
- Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
- Sustained grip strength bilaterally
- Sustained tongue protrusion
- No fasciculations
- Adequate cough and gag reflex

**Do NOT Extubate If:**
- Any somnolence remains
- TOF <0.9
- Inadequate respiratory effort (RR <10, TV <5 mL/kg)
- Hemodynamic instability
- Active bleeding or surgical concern
- Patient confused or combative

**Special Populations:**

| Population | Additional Considerations |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Elderly (>75)** | Lower threshold to delay extubation; ensure fully awake |
| **Frail** | Extended observation before extubation decision |
| **OSA** | More stringent criteria; ensure robust ventilation |
| **Cardiac Disease** | Ensure hemodynamic stability before airway manipulation |

### 7.5 Post-Extubation Care

**Immediate post-extubation:**
- Apply supplemental O₂ (nasal cannula 2–4 L/min or simple face mask 6–8 L/min)
- Continue standard ASA monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP, RR)
- Position patient semi-upright (30–45 degrees if not contraindicated)
- Suction oropharynx PRN (avoid deep suctioning)

**Assessment:**
- Pain level (numeric rating scale 0–10)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Orientation and mental status
- Motor function (especially leg/knee - verify blocks working but quads preserved)
- Sensation distribution (verify blocks working)

**Communication to PACU:**
See Section 8.6 (Handoff to PACU)

---

## 8. Postoperative Pain Management

> **Expected pain profile with functioning blocks: NRS 0–3 for first 12–18 hours.**

### 8.1 Expected Pain Profile

**With functioning ACB + IPACK blocks:**

| Time Period | Expected NRS | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0–6 hours** | 0–2 | Excellent analgesia; minimal rescue needs |
| **6–12 hours** | 1–3 | Good analgesia; occasional rescue |
| **12–18 hours** | 2–4 | Block beginning to wear off; transition to oral regimen |
| **18–24 hours** | 3–5 | Oral multimodal regimen primary |

**If NRS ≥4 in first 6 hours:**
- Assess block quality (test sensation, motor function)
- Consider tourniquet pain contribution (resolves quickly)
- Evaluate for surgical complications (hematoma, compartment syndrome, fracture)
- Implement rescue analgesia (see Section 8.3)

### 8.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia (Foundation for All Patients)

**Start immediately in PACU and continue on floor:**

| Medication | Dose | Route | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg | PO/IV | Every 6 hours | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment)<br>4 g/day (normal liver) | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg | PO | Every 12 hours | 400 mg/day | **First-line NSAID** (selective COX-2)<br>**Avoid:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent CV event |
| **Ketorolac** (alternative) | 15 mg | IV | Every 6 hours | 60 mg/day; max 5 days | **Use with caution:** Age >65, CrCl <50, bleeding risk<br>Consider avoiding in elderly |
| **Meloxicam** (alternative) | 7.5–15 mg | PO | Once daily | 15 mg/day | Alternative NSAID if celecoxib not available |

**NSAID Decision-Making:**
- **Strong benefit when safe:** Reduce opioid requirement by 30–50%
- **High caution required in:**
  - Elderly (>75 years)
  - Renal impairment (CrCl <50)
  - Cardiovascular disease (recent MI/stroke, heart failure)
  - Concurrent anticoagulation (bleeding risk)
  - Gastrointestinal disease (ulcer, bleeding history)
- **Prefer selective COX-2 (celecoxib)** over ketorolac in higher-risk patients
- **Duration:** Limit to 5 days maximum; reassess daily

### 8.3 Rescue Analgesia (Conservative Stepwise Approach)

> **Use multimodal rescue before resorting to opioids.**

#### Step 1: Reassess and Optimize

**Before administering rescue medications:**
- [ ] Verify scheduled multimodal medications given on time
- [ ] Ensure blocks are functioning (test sensation in expected distribution)
- [ ] Reposition patient for comfort
- [ ] Apply ice to surgical site (if not contraindicated)
- [ ] Assess for surgical complications (see Section 10.2)

#### Step 2: Ketamine Rescue (If Institutional Protocol Allows)

**Indication:** Moderate to severe pain (NRS 5–7) unresponsive to multimodal foundation

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Maximum |
|-------------------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard adult** | **10–20 mg IV** (0.1–0.15 mg/kg) | Slow push over 1–2 minutes | ~3 doses per reassessment period |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **7–10 mg IV** (0.1 mg/kg) | Slow push over 2 minutes | 2 doses maximum |
| **Frail** | **7–10 mg IV** or **omit** | Slow push over 2 minutes | Consider opioid alternative |

**Reassessment Interval:** 10–15 minutes after each dose

**Reduce Dose or Omit When:**
- Elderly, frail, or hemodynamically unstable
- Tachyarrhythmia-prone patients
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Blood pressure every 5 minutes for first 15 minutes after dose
- Assess for dissociative effects (patients may appear "zoned out" - reassure)

**Institutional Variability:**
- Ketamine as PACU rescue is **not universally adopted**
- Verify local policy before implementation
- Some institutions prefer opioid rescue as first-line

#### Step 3: Opioid Rescue (If Ketamine Inadequate or Contraindicated)

**Indication:** Severe pain (NRS ≥7) unresponsive to multimodal + ketamine, or ketamine contraindicated

| Patient Population | First Dose | Reassessment Interval | Subsequent Doses |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Standard adult (opioid-naïve)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **Frail** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV; consider longer intervals |
| **Chronic opioid use** | **Hydromorphone 0.4–0.8 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | Titrate to effect; anticipate tolerance |

**Enhanced Monitoring Requirements:**
- **Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry** until stable and pain controlled
- **Consider capnography** for OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve, or high cumulative opioid dose
- **Sedation assessment** every 10–15 minutes using standardized scale (RASS, Pasero)
- **Respiratory rate** every 10–15 minutes; alert if <10 breaths/min

**Naloxone Availability:**
- **Immediately available** at bedside (0.4 mg ampules)
- Dosing if respiratory depression: **0.04–0.08 mg IV** titrated (avoid full reversal/withdrawal)
- May repeat every 2–3 minutes until respiratory rate ≥10 and adequate TV

**Escalation Criteria:**
- If NRS remains ≥6 despite maximal multimodal + ketamine + opioids → **Consult attending anesthesiologist**
- Consider alternative strategies:
  - Continuous peripheral nerve block (catheter technique)
  - Epidural analgesia (rare for TKA)
  - Regional anesthesia consultation
  - Pain medicine consultation
- **Evaluate for surgical complications** (see Section 10.2)

### 8.4 Block Duration and Transition Planning

**ACB + IPACK expected duration:**
- Typical: 12–18 hours (variable)
- Factors affecting duration: concentration, volume, patient metabolism, surgical trauma

**Transition to Oral Regimen:**
- **Before block resolution:** Ensure oral multimodal medications given and therapeutic
- **Anticipate:** Pain increase as block wears off (typically evening of surgery or next morning)
- **Preemptive:** Give scheduled acetaminophen and NSAID 1–2 hours before expected block resolution
- **Reassess frequently:** Every 2–4 hours during transition period

**Oral Opioid Prescription (If Needed):**
- Use **lowest effective dose and shortest duration**
- Typical: Oxycodone 5 mg PO q4h PRN pain (max 30 mg/24h)
- **Counsel patient:**
  - Take scheduled non-opioid medications first
  - Use opioids only for breakthrough pain
  - Constipation prophylaxis (senna, docusate)
  - Safe storage and disposal
  - Do not drive or operate machinery while taking opioids

### 8.5 Mobilization and Physical Therapy

**Goal:** POD 0 ambulation within 4–6 hours post-op

**Quadriceps-Sparing Intent:**
- ACB + IPACK designed to preserve quadriceps strength
- **Before ambulation:** Physical therapist assesses motor function
- **Verify:** Patient can perform straight leg raise and support weight
- **If quadriceps weakness:** Delay ambulation, reassess block distribution

**Mobilization Protocol:**
- **Phase 1 (2–4 hours):** Sit at edge of bed with assistance
- **Phase 2 (4–6 hours):** Stand with walker and PT assistance
- **Phase 3 (6–8 hours):** Ambulate 10–20 feet with walker
- **Progression:** As tolerated per PT assessment and pain control

**Barriers to Early Mobilization:**
- Inadequate pain control (NRS >6)
- Excessive sedation (from opioids or adjuncts)
- PONV
- Hypotension or dizziness
- Quadriceps weakness (assess block technique if unexpected)

### 8.6 Handoff to PACU

## 9. Safety Monitoring

### 9.1 Intraoperative Monitoring (Standard ASA)

**Required for all patients:**
- Continuous ECG (5-lead preferred)
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Continuous capnography (from intubation to extubation)
- Blood pressure every 3–5 minutes (non-invasive) or continuous arterial line
- Temperature monitoring (core or near-core)
- Inspired and expired gas analysis (O₂, volatile agent, CO₂)
- Airway pressures and volumes

**Additional considerations:**
- **Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy):** Consider in elderly (>75) or frail patients to avoid excessive anesthetic depth
- **Arterial line:** Severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability, need for frequent blood gas analysis
- **Central venous access:** Not routine for TKA; consider if severe cardiac disease or anticipated large blood loss

### 9.2 Regional Block Monitoring

**During block placement:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Intermittent blood pressure every 5 minutes
- Verbal responsiveness maintained (conscious sedation level)
- Monitoring for 30 minutes after block completion

**LAST vigilance:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, seizures
- Late: Cardiovascular collapse (arrhythmias, severe hypotension, cardiac arrest)
- **Lipid emulsion 20% immediately available** (see Section 4.5)

### 9.3 Neuromuscular Monitoring (Train-of-Four)

> **TOF monitoring is MANDATORY for all patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.**

**Equipment:**
- Quantitative TOF monitor preferred (measures and displays TOF ratio)
- Qualitative assessment (tactile/visual) acceptable if quantitative unavailable
- Typically applied to ulnar nerve (adductor pollicis response)

**Monitoring Points:**
- After rocuronium administration (confirm adequate blockade for intubation)
- Throughout case (if additional NMB doses given)
- Before sugammadex administration (determine dose)
- **After sugammadex administration (confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9)**
- **Before extubation (verify TOF ratio ≥0.9)**

**Magnesium Caveat:**
- Magnesium **potentiates neuromuscular blockade**
- Anticipate **longer duration of paralysis**
- May require **higher sugammadex dose**
- **More frequent TOF assessments** recommended

**TOF Ratio Interpretation:**
- TOF ratio <0.4: Deep blockade
- TOF ratio 0.4–0.7: Moderate blockade
- TOF ratio 0.7–0.9: Mild residual blockade (clinical weakness possible)
- **TOF ratio ≥0.9: Adequate recovery (safe for extubation)**

**DO NOT EXTUBATE if TOF <0.9** unless exceptional circumstances and senior attending approval.

### 9.4 PACU Monitoring

**Standard PACU monitoring (all Protocol 1 patients):**
- Continuous pulse oximetry (minimum 1 hour, longer if sedation persists)
- Blood pressure every 15 minutes initially, then every 30 minutes when stable
- Respiratory rate every 15 minutes
- Pain assessment (NRS) every 15–30 minutes
- Sedation assessment every 15 minutes initially
- Nausea/vomiting assessment
- Surgical site assessment (dressing, drains, neurovascular status)

**Enhanced monitoring for high-risk subgroups:**

| Risk Factor | Additional Monitoring |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | Consider capnography; continuous pulse oximetry until fully awake and stable |
| **Elderly (>75) or frail** | More frequent respiratory and sedation assessments (every 10 min initially) |
| **Opioid given intraoperatively (protocol deviation)** | Enhanced respiratory monitoring; continuous pulse oximetry; consider capnography |
| **High cumulative opioid in PACU** | Continuous pulse oximetry; capnography strongly recommended; frequent sedation scores |

**Naloxone preparedness:**
- Immediately available at bedside for any patient receiving opioids
- Dosing: 0.04–0.08 mg IV titrated (avoid full reversal)

**LAST preparedness:**
- 20% lipid emulsion immediately available in PACU
- LAST protocol posted and staff trained

### 9.5 Floor Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**Standard for all patients:**
- Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, temp) every 4 hours
- Pain assessment with each vital sign check
- Sedation assessment with each vital sign check
- Neurovascular checks (distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, motor) every 4 hours

**Enhanced monitoring (high-risk patients):**
- OSA: Consider continuous pulse oximetry overnight per institutional protocol
- Significant opioid consumption in PACU: More frequent assessments (every 2 hours)
- Frail/elderly with opioid exposure: Lower threshold for monitored bed (step-down unit)

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### 10.1 Inadequate Analgesia Despite Blocks

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Cause | Assessment | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Block failure (technical)** | Test sensory distribution; compare to expected | Consider rescue block or conversion to Protocol 3 |
| **Incomplete block coverage** | Anterior knee pain suggests ACB issue; posterior pain suggests IPACK issue | Multimodal rescue ± opioid |
| **Tourniquet pain** | Timing (during inflation); resolves quickly post-deflation | Usually self-limited; opioid if severe |
| **Surgical complication** | Increasing pain over time; tense compartment; neurovascular changes | **Emergency surgical consult** |

**Management Algorithm:**
1. **Verify block distribution:** Test sensation in expected areas (medial leg for ACB, posterior knee for IPACK)
2. **Optimize multimodal:** Ensure scheduled meds given on time
3. **Ketamine rescue:** 10–20 mg IV if institutional protocol allows
4. **Opioid rescue:** Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV titrated
5. **If refractory:** Consult attending anesthesiologist, consider regional rescue or alternative strategy

### 10.2 Concern for Surgical Complication

**Red flags requiring immediate evaluation:**

| Finding | Concern | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Increasing pain over time** | Hematoma, compartment syndrome | Surgical consult; remove dressing to assess |
| **Tense, swollen compartment** | Compartment syndrome | **Emergency surgical consult**; measure compartment pressures |
| **Absent distal pulses** | Vascular injury | **Emergency vascular surgery consult** |
| **New motor deficit** | Nerve injury, compartment syndrome | Surgical consult; document neuro exam |
| **Severe pain with passive stretch** | Compartment syndrome | **Emergency surgical consult** |
| **Numbness beyond expected block distribution** | Nerve injury | Surgical consult; document distribution |

**Do NOT attribute severe, progressive pain to "inadequate block" without ruling out surgical complications.**

### 10.3 Dexmedetomidine-Related Bradycardia

**Management Algorithm:**

| Heart Rate | Symptoms | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **HR 50–55** | Asymptomatic | Reduce dexmedetomidine by 50%; monitor closely |
| **HR 50–55** | Symptomatic (dizziness, chest pain) | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **HR 45–50** | Any | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **HR <45** | Any | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg IV; consider atropine if severe |

**If recurrent despite management:** Discontinue dexmedetomidine for remainder of case.

**Document:**
- Bradycardia event and management
- Dexmedetomidine total dose and duration
- Patient response to intervention

### 10.4 Ketamine-Related Issues

**Dissociative Emergence ("Emergence Delirium"):**

| Presentation | Management |
|--------------|------------|
| Agitation, confusion, hallucinations | Calm, quiet environment; minimize stimulation; reorient frequently |
| Severe agitation | Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (caution in elderly) |
| Prolonged (>30 min) | Consider low-dose propofol (10–20 mg IV) or dexmedetomidine |

**Hypertension/Tachycardia:**
- If severe (SBP >180): Consider labetalol 5–10 mg IV or esmolol 10–20 mg IV
- Usually transient; resolves with ketamine cessation

**Nystagmus, Diplopia:**
- Reassure patient these are expected effects and will resolve
- Usually benign and self-limited

### 10.5 Hypotension Refractory to Vasopressors

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Cause | Assessment | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Hypovolemia** | Low UOP, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure | Fluid bolus 250–500 mL crystalloid |
| **Excessive anesthetic depth** | BIS <40, low ETCO₂ | Reduce propofol/sevoflurane |
| **Dexmedetomidine effect** | Recent loading or high infusion rate | Stop dexmedetomidine |
| **Hemorrhage** | Increasing drain output, tachycardia, falling Hgb | Surgical assessment; transfusion if indicated |
| **Cardiac (rare)** | ECG changes, elevated troponin | Cardiology consult; consider ICU |

**Escalation:**
- If MAP <60 despite phenylephrine infusion → Consider epinephrine infusion (0.01–0.05 mcg/kg/min)
- If concern for cardiac etiology → Arterial line, consider TEE or TTE

### 10.6 Prolonged Neuromuscular Blockade

**Causes:**
- Magnesium administration (most common in Protocol 1)
- Renal impairment
- Hypothermia
- Electrolyte abnormalities (hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia)
- Drug interactions

**Management:**
1. **Verify sugammadex dose adequate:** May need additional dose (consult attending)
2. **Check TOF ratio repeatedly:** May take longer than expected
3. **Assess temperature:** Warm patient if hypothermic (<36°C)
4. **Consider labs:** Magnesium, calcium, potassium if prolonged
5. **If persistent:** Maintain ventilatory support, consider ICU transfer

**Do NOT extubate** until TOF ratio ≥0.9 achieved.

---

## 11. Clinical Pearls

### Regional Anesthesia Pearls

1. **Block placement timing matters:** Perform blocks before induction when possible (patient positioning easier, verification of motor-sparing intent, reduced total anesthetic time).

2. **Ropivacaine 0.2% is the sweet spot:** Provides excellent analgesia while minimizing motor blockade and systemic toxicity risk. Do not reflexively use 0.5% "because that's what the pharmacy sends."

3. **Document quadriceps strength:** Have patient perform straight leg raise after ACB to verify motor-sparing intent. If quadriceps weakness occurs, adjust technique for future cases.

4. **LAST preparedness is non-negotiable:** Lipid emulsion must be immediately available (within 3 minutes). Do not start blocks without it.

5. **Total LA dose accounting:** Always document surgeon's periarticular infiltration volume/concentration. Total systemic LA burden = blocks + surgical infiltration.

### Induction and Maintenance Pearls

6. **Propofol hypotension is predictable:** Have vasopressor drawn and ready BEFORE pushing propofol. Don't wait to see if patient becomes hypotensive.

7. **Dexmedetomidine: no bolus, ever (for routine cases):** Infusion-only strategy minimizes bradycardia and hypotension. Start low (0.2 mcg/kg/hr) and titrate up if needed.

8. **Ketamine and BIS don't mix well:** If using ketamine, don't titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS. Use clinical signs (movement, tachycardia, hypertension) and raw EEG if available.

9. **Magnesium prolongs paralysis:** If you load magnesium, anticipate needing more time for sugammadex to work. Check TOF early and often near end of case.

10. **Taper adjuncts early:** Stop/reduce dexmedetomidine and ketamine 10–15 minutes before case end. Prolonged sedation delays PACU discharge and mobilization.

### Emergence and Recovery Pearls

11. **TOF ≥0.9 is mandatory, not a suggestion:** Residual neuromuscular blockade is a patient safety issue. Verify quantitatively before extubation.

12. **Protocol 1 emergence is usually smooth:** Unlike opioid-heavy anesthetics, OFIA patients typically wake up alert and comfortable. Don't over-treat "light" anesthesia at end of case.

13. **Early mobilization is the goal:** With functioning blocks and opioid-sparing technique, most patients can sit up in 2–4 hours and ambulate with PT in 4–6 hours. Don't delay mobilization unnecessarily.

### PACU Management Pearls

14. **Expected pain with functioning blocks: 0–3:** If NRS ≥4 in first 6 hours, something is wrong. Assess blocks, rule out surgical complications, don't just give more opioids.

15. **Ketamine rescue is underutilized:** Where institutional protocols allow, ketamine 10–20 mg IV is excellent for breakthrough pain without respiratory depression. Educate PACU staff on dissociative effects (patient may seem "zoned out" - this is expected and temporary).

16. **OSA patients do great with Protocol 1:** Opioid-sparing + regional analgesia dramatically reduces respiratory complications. Protocol 1 is PREFERRED for OSA, not contraindicated.

17. **Block transition planning:** Anticipate block wearing off 12–18 hours post-op. Ensure scheduled multimodal meds in place before resolution. Preemptive analgesia > reactive.

### Pathway Selection Pearls

18. **Protocol 1 is first-line for a reason:** Best pain control, lowest PONV, earliest mobilization, opioid-sparing. Use it unless contraindications exist.

19. **When blocks not feasible → Protocol 2, not Protocol 3:** If anticoagulation timing doesn't allow blocks, use Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free). Reserve Protocol 3 for patients truly requiring opioids.

20. **Elderly patients benefit most:** Despite needing dose reductions, elderly patients get enormous benefit from opioid-sparing strategy. Lower delirium, less respiratory depression, faster recovery.

### Safety Pearls

21. **LAST can happen with "safe" doses:** Local anesthetic toxicity is about absorption and vascular uptake, not just total dose. Be vigilant even with conservative dosing.

22. **Adjuncts are adjuncts:** Dexmedetomidine, ketamine, magnesium, lidocaine are analgesic/sympatholytic adjuncts. They do NOT replace propofol/sevoflurane for maintaining unconsciousness.

23. **Special populations need special consideration:** Elderly, frail, OSA, cardiac disease all require dose reductions and enhanced monitoring. "One size fits all" does not apply in anesthesia.

## Appendix B: Patient Information Sheet

### What is Protocol 1 (OFIA + Regional Blocks)?

**For patients and families:**

Protocol 1 is an anesthesia approach designed to minimize opioid use while providing excellent pain control for your knee replacement surgery. Here's what to expect:

**Before Surgery:**
- You'll receive oral pain medications (acetaminophen and an anti-inflammatory)
- We'll place numbing medicine injections around your knee using ultrasound guidance
- These "nerve blocks" will numb your knee for 12–18 hours after surgery

**During Surgery:**
- You'll be completely asleep and won't feel anything
- We use medications for sleep and pain control that are NOT opioids
- The nerve blocks will keep your knee numb during and after surgery

**After Surgery:**
- Your knee should be very comfortable (little to no pain) for the first 12–18 hours
- You'll receive regular non-opioid pain medications (pills and IV)
- If you need additional pain relief, we have other options available
- Most patients can sit up and walk with assistance on the same day as surgery

**Benefits:**
- Excellent pain control without heavy opioid use
- Less nausea and drowsiness
- Faster recovery and earlier walking
- Shorter hospital stay

**Questions?**
Ask your anesthesiologist or surgeon for more information.

Quick reference comparing three commonly used anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). Protocols are **informed by** ERAS guidance, ASA/APSF safety recommendations, and ASRA regional anesthesia/anticoagulation standards but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized.  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Special populations (e.g., severe cardiopulmonary disease, extremes of age, BMI, or renal/hepatic dysfunction) require additional modification.

## Induction (Typical Adult Ranges; Individualize)

> **Note on lidocaine:** Many workflows administer **lidocaine 20–40 mg IV** (or ~0.5 mg/kg) immediately before propofol to reduce **propofol injection discomfort**. This is separate from a **lidocaine infusion**.

|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Midazolam** | 0–0.5 mg IV *only if needed* at induction (often omit if already used for blocks) | 0–0.5 mg IV *only if needed* | 0–0.5 mg IV *only if needed* |
| **Lidocaine (IV push)** | 20–40 mg IV (optional, for propofol injection comfort) | 20–40 mg IV (optional) | 20–40 mg IV (optional) |

## Maintenance Anesthesia

### Maintenance Backbone (Repository Standard)
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to physiology and depth targets)  
- **Sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)** may be used **as an adjunct or workflow-dependent alternative** per attending preference and case needs.

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Hypnotic backbone** | Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min | Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min | Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min |
| **Volatile (optional)** | Sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC (optional/additive) | Sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC (optional/additive) | Sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC (optional/additive) |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr (selection-dependent; lower range in frail/bradycardic) | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr (selection-dependent; lower range in frail/bradycardic) | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr (optional) |
| **Ketamine infusion** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr (optional) | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr (optional) | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr (optional; often for tolerance) |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Not routine | 1–2 mg/kg/hr (optional; institutional limits/contraindications apply) | Optional per institutional policy (generally conservative) |
| **Intraop opioids** | **None** (OFIA goal; convert only if clinically required) | **None** (OFIA goal; convert only if clinically required) | **Fentanyl infusion (continuous) as primary strategy**; avoid “boluses PRN” framing as default |

---

## Opioid Strategy Clarification (Protocol 3)

> **Repository rule (per discussion):** intraoperative opioids are **not described as “boluses PRN” as the default plan**. When opioids are used for rTKA, they are typically delivered as a **continuous fentanyl infusion**, with dose titration to physiology and surgical stimulation.

**Typical fentanyl infusion range (illustrative; institution-dependent):**
- **Fentanyl 0.5–2 mcg/kg/hr IV infusion**, titrate to effect and patient phenotype  
  - Lower end favored in elderly/OSA/frail or when regional analgesia is strong  
  - Higher end may be required for opioid tolerance or high stimulation periods  
- If an additional dose is required, document as a **titrated supplemental dose** (not “boluses PRN” as a standing plan).

---

## Hemodynamic Management (All Protocols)

| Parameter | Typical Approach |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Target MAP** | ≥65 mmHg (individualize for baseline HTN, CAD, cerebrovascular disease) |
| **Phenylephrine** | 50–100 mcg IV boluses (hypotension with HR >70) |
| **Ephedrine** | 5–10 mg IV boluses (hypotension with HR <60) |
| **Bradycardia treatment** | Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV (common first-line in this context) |
| **Dex-related bradycardia** | Reduce/stop infusion if HR <50 with symptoms OR <45 regardless; treat per institutional protocol |

---

## Emergence

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **10–15 min before end** | Taper/stop dexmedetomidine (if used) | Taper/stop dexmedetomidine (if used) | Taper/stop adjuncts; review opioid timing |
| **At skin closure** | Stop ketamine (if used); step down propofol/volatile | Stop ketamine ± lidocaine infusion (if used); step down propofol/volatile | Taper fentanyl infusion and avoid late escalation; step down propofol/volatile |
| **Ondansetron** | 4 mg IV | 4 mg IV | 4 mg IV (high priority with opioid exposure) |
| **Sugammadex** | 2 mg/kg (TOF count ≥2) or 4 mg/kg (deep block) | 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg | 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg |
| **Extubation criteria** | Awake, adequate ventilation, TOF ratio ≥0.9, SpO₂ >92% | Same | **More stringent**: fully awake, minimal somnolence, robust ventilation; low threshold to delay extubation in OSA/elderly |
| **Expected emergence** | Often smooth, ~10–15 min (variable) | Often smooth, ~10–15 min (variable) | Variable; may be prolonged with higher opioid burden |

## Contraindications Summary (High-Level)

### Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) – Generally avoid when:
- Patient refuses blocks
- Anticoagulation outside ASRA + institutional windows
- Amide local anesthetic allergy
- Adjunct strategy not appropriate for physiology (selection-dependent)

### Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) – Generally avoid when:
- OFIA adjunct strategy is not appropriate for physiology (selection-dependent), or attending determines opioid-inclusive approach safer

### Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) – Use when:
- OFIA pathways are contraindicated or not desired/feasible
- Chronic opioid tolerance requires an opioid-inclusive framework
- Patient preference after counseling

## ASRA 2024–2025 Anticoagulation Timing (Simplified Summary)

> Applies to Protocols 1 & 3 when deep peripheral blocks (ACB/IPACK) are performed. Use **institutional tables** as source of truth.

| Anticoagulant | Preoperative Hold (Typical) | Postoperative Restart (Typical) |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **DOACs** (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) | ≥72 h (CrCl >50)<br>≥120 h (CrCl <50) | ≥6 h after block/catheter removal |
| **Dabigatran** | 72–120 h (renal function dependent) | ≥6 h after block/catheter removal |
| **Warfarin** | Target INR ≤1.4 (day-of) | Per surgical/medicine team |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24 h | ≥24 h after block/catheter removal |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥12 h | ≥6 h after block/catheter removal |
| **Aspirin** | No hold required (per ASRA for peripheral blocks) | Continue |
| **Clopidogrel** | Follow institutional policy | Follow institutional policy |
| **NSAIDs** | No hold required | Continue |

---

## Key Decision Points (Summary)

### Choose Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) when:
- Blocks are safe/feasible and patient accepts
- Goal is maximal early analgesia and ERAS optimization

### Choose Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) when:
- Anticoagulation timing prevents blocks, blocks refused, or anatomy/workflow limits blocks
- Surgeon periarticular infiltration is available and documented

### Choose Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive) when:
- OFIA components are not appropriate or not desired
- Chronic opioid tolerance requires opioid-inclusive intraoperative analgesia
- Enhanced monitoring resources are in place

---

## Clinical Pearls

- **Propofol induction** 1.5–2 mg/kg is a common starting range; dose-reduce and titrate in frail/elderly/hemodynamically limited patients.
- **Propofol TIVA** is maintained as a **clear, explicit backbone** in this repository’s intraoperative frameworks; **sevoflurane** may be used as an adjunct or workflow-dependent alternative.
- **Fentanyl (Protocol 3)** is framed as a **continuous infusion strategy** (titrated), not as “opioid boluses PRN” as the default plan.
- **Lidocaine IV push** (20–40 mg) immediately before propofol is a common method to reduce injection discomfort and does not imply a lidocaine infusion.
- **Early mobilization** remains a central endpoint: Protocols 1 & 2 often support POD 0 ambulation when physiology and workflow permit.

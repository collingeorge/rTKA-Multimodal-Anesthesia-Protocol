# rTKA Anesthesia Protocol Comparison Table

Quick reference comparing three commonly used anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty. Protocols are **informed by** ERAS 2024, ASA/APSF 2024, and ASRA 2024–2025 guidance but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized.  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Special populations (e.g., severe cardiopulmonary disease, extremes of age, BMI, or renal/hepatic dysfunction) require additional modification.

| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Preferred** (opioid-sparing + regional) | **Preferred** vs opioid-heavy pathway | Generally **avoid if possible**; use with enhanced monitoring if required |
| **Elderly/frail (>80 years)** | **Preferred** | **Preferred** | Generally **avoid if possible** due to delirium/respiratory risk |
| **Chronic opioid use** | Appropriate; consider for tolerance with blocks + ketamine | Appropriate; consider for tolerance | Also appropriate; anticipate higher opioid requirements and enhanced monitoring |

## Contraindications Summary  
*(Summarizes common concerns; final decisions follow institutional policy and attending judgment.)*

### Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) – Generally AVOID if:

**OFIA components contraindicated:**
- Active psychosis (ketamine generally contraindicated)
- High-degree AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided)
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30) when magnesium planned

**Block contraindications (ACB/IPACK):**
- Patient refusal
- Active systemic infection/sepsis
- Anticoagulation outside ASRA 2024–2025 timing windows (see table below)

- Chronic opioid use >~30 MME/day for >3 months (with careful planning and monitoring)  
- Patient preference after balanced counseling

**Generally AVOID if possible for:**
- Severe OSA (STOP-Bang ≥5)
- Frail elderly (age >80, high delirium/respiratory risk)
- History of severe PONV
- History of postoperative respiratory failure or high-risk respiratory disease

## ASRA 2024–2025 Anticoagulation Timing  
*(Applies to Protocols 1 & 3 if ACB/IPACK or other peripheral blocks are performed. This is a simplified summary; refer to full ASRA guidelines and institutional policy.)*

| Anticoagulant | Preoperative Hold (Typical) | Postoperative Restart (Typical) |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|

| **Aspirin** | No hold required for peripheral blocks (per ASRA) | Continue |
| **Clopidogrel** | Typically no hold for superficial blocks; follow local policy | Continue per institutional guidance |
| **NSAIDs** | No hold required | Continue |

## Key Decision Points (Summary)

### When to Choose Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks)
- **Generally preferred first-line** for medically suitable patients  
- Best expected pain control (NRS ~0–3)  
- Lowest expected PONV rates (<~10%)  
- Anticoagulation within ASRA timing windows  
- Patient accepts blocks after informed counseling  

### When to Choose Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free)
- Anticoagulation outside ASRA timing windows for blocks  
- Patient refuses blocks or anatomy makes blocks difficult  
- Need to preserve workflow speed but still leverage OFIA benefits  
- Desire to avoid intraoperative opioids while accepting higher ketamine/dex use  

### When to Choose Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid)
- OFIA components contraindicated or not desired (e.g., psychosis, AV block, severe renal disease affecting ketamine/dex/magnesium)  
- Chronic opioid user >~30 MME/day where conventional pathway is preferred by attending or pain service  
- Patient or practitioner preference after balanced risk–benefit discussion  
- OFIA expertise, monitoring, or resources are limited

## Clinical Pearls

### All Protocols Share:
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg** is the typical adult induction range at many centers (dose-reduce in elderly/frail).  
- **Sevoflurane ~0.8–1.2 MAC** is a common primary maintenance choice (propofol TIVA is a strong alternative in high PONV or MH-risk patients).  
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg preop** is a typical anxiolytic starting range but should be reduced or omitted in frail/OSA/elderly patients.  
- **Multimodal analgesia is essential** regardless of pathway; opioids alone are rarely optimal.  
- **Early mobilization is a key goal** (POD 0 ideal for Protocols 1 & 2; POD 1 is often more realistic for opioid-heavy pathways).

### Protocol-Specific Notes:
- **Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks):**  
  - Often the preferred pathway when feasible – regional blocks provide superior analgesia and facilitate POD 0 mobilization.  
  - Plan for ~12–18 h of block duration; consider nighttime “rebound” pain and ensure scheduled oral regimen is in place.

- **Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free):**  
  - Higher ketamine and dexmedetomidine doses are often used to compensate for lack of regional analgesia.  
  - **Surgeon local infiltration is critical**, not optional, for good outcomes.

- **Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid):**  
  - Requires heightened vigilance for respiratory depression, sedation, and PONV—especially in OSA, elderly, and opioid-naïve patients.  
  - PONV, delirium, and respiratory risk are generally higher; consider adding regional blocks even within an opioid-based pathway to reduce total opioid requirements by ~30–50%.

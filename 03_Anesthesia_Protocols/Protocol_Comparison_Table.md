# rTKA Anesthesia Protocol Comparison Table

**Version:** 2.1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14  
**Clinical Validation Standard:** Propofol-centered, physiology-first anesthetic framework using conservative dosing, risk stratification, and controlled emergence.

---

Quick reference comparing three evidence-based anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). All protocols reflect conservative, safety-first dosing with mandatory individualization.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses represent conservative starting points requiring titration to physiologic response.  
> - Institutional protocols and attending anesthesiologist judgment supersede all recommendations.  
> - Special populations require additional dose reduction and monitoring intensification.

## Attending Validation Summary
### (What This Table Is Designed to Produce When Applied Correctly)

This comparison table is structured to match the attending anesthesiologist’s real-world decision model:

1. **Induction is reliable:** loss of consciousness is achieved predictably with a **propofol IV bolus** (with indicated co-boluses), supporting consistent airway conditions.  
2. **Maintenance is controllable:** unconsciousness is maintained with a **propofol infusion** as the hypnotic spine; adjuncts modulate analgesia and sympathetic tone rather than serving as primary hypnosis.  
3. **Physiology is actively managed:** hemodynamic targets, vasoactive rescue strategy, neuromuscular blockade monitoring, and depth considerations are explicit and proactive.  
4. **Emergence is protected:** infusions are tapered in advance, late opioids are avoided, **TOF ≥ 0.9** is confirmed, and extubation criteria are risk-stratified.

---

## Universal Workflow Principles
### (Applied Across All Three Protocols)

These principles reflect common attending practice patterns and are intentionally phrased as defaults (not absolutes).

### Induction: Bolus-Dominant Strategy
- Induction is typically bolus-driven to achieve rapid, reliable loss of consciousness and airway conditions.
- A **propofol IV bolus** is the default hypnotic event for induction in this framework.
- Adjunct boluses (e.g., fentanyl in opioid-inclusive pathways, ketamine when indicated) are used to blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, not to replace hypnosis.

### Maintenance: Continuous Delivery Strategy
- Maintenance is typically infusion- or continuous-delivery–based to avoid depth oscillation and maintain physiologic stability.
- **Propofol infusion** serves as the default hypnotic spine in this framework.
- Volatile agent (e.g., sevoflurane) may be used as an optional adjunct per workflow or institutional practice; it is not required.

### Emergence: Planned Taper and Verification
- Emergence is treated as a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning.
- Hypnotic and adjunct infusions are tapered 10–15 minutes prior to anticipated end of surgery.
- Avoid late opioids when feasible.
- Confirm **TOF ≥ 0.9** and meet extubation criteria prior to airway removal.

## Protocol Selection Guide (Which Analgesic Strategy Fits the Patient)

| Patient Factor | Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **First-line choice?** | **Preferred** when blocks feasible and safe | Preferred when blocks contraindicated/refused | Use when OFIA is inappropriate/contraindicated or resources limit OFIA |
| **Anticoagulation timing** | Must meet **ASRA + institutional** requirements for deep peripheral blocks | **Any timing** (no blocks) | **Any timing** if no blocks; ASRA timing if blocks used |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Strongly preferred** | **Strongly preferred** | **Avoid if possible**; if used → enhanced monitoring + conservative opioids |
| **Elderly/frail (>75 or frailty)** | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Avoid if possible**; higher delirium/respiratory risk |
| **Chronic opioid use** | Appropriate; continue home regimen | Appropriate; continue home regimen | Appropriate; anticipate tolerance and enhanced monitoring |

| **Active psychosis** | Ketamine contraindicated | Ketamine contraindicated | May be preferred option |

---

## Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Aligned)

| Medication | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 60–90 min pre-op | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 1–2 hrs pre-op | Avoid: CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | After IV access | Consider 4–6 mg if diabetic; monitor glucose |
| **Scopolamine patch** | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | Evening prior or ≥4 hrs pre-op | High PONV risk only; contraindicated in glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | Holding area | Reduce or avoid in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | N/A | Sedation/delirium risk often outweighs benefit |
| **Home opioids** | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Morning of surgery | Do not escalate pre-op |

---

## Regional Analgesia

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Adductor Canal Block (ACB)** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **IPACK** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **Total ropivacaine dose** | **80 mg** | N/A | 80 mg if blocks performed |
| **ASRA anticoagulation compliance** | **Mandatory** | N/A | Mandatory if blocks performed |
| **20% lipid emulsion (LAST)** | Immediately available | N/A | Immediately available if blocks performed |
| **Expected duration** | 12–18 hours | N/A | 12–18 hours if blocks performed |
| **Motor preservation** | Quadriceps-sparing intent | N/A | Quadriceps-sparing intent if blocks performed |

**Rationale (conservative):** 0.2% concentration with total ~80 mg reduces LAST risk while maintaining effective analgesia.

---

## Induction (Bolus-Based, Conservative Adult Starting Points)

> **Lidocaine note:** 20–40 mg IV immediately before propofol may reduce injection pain (separate from any infusion use).

| Agent | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) | Special Population Adjustments |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Midazolam** | 0–1 mg IV | 0–1 mg IV | 0–1 mg IV | Age >75/frail/OSA: 0.5 mg max or omit |
| **Lidocaine (pain reduction)** | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | Optional |
| **Propofol (hypnotic)** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV bolus** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV bolus** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV bolus** | Age >75/frail/cardiac: 1–1.5 mg/kg; slow titration |
| **Ketamine (analgesic adjunct)** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2 mg/kg IV (optional) | Frail/elderly: 0.2 mg/kg max or omit |
| **Fentanyl (opioid pathway)** | None | None | **50–100 mcg IV bolus** (typical opioid induction co-bolus) | Elderly/OSA/opioid-naïve: start 25–50 mcg |
| **Rocuronium** | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | Dose to IBW in obesity; TOF monitoring mandatory |
| **Dexmedetomidine bolus** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | Bolus increases bradycardia/hypotension risk |
| **Magnesium bolus** | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | Not routine | Contraindicated: CrCl <30, MG, heart block |

**Critical induction safety:**
- Anticipate **propofol hypotension**: have phenylephrine drawn and available.
- Ketamine contraindicated: active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN (institution-dependent thresholds).
- Magnesium potentiates NMBD: anticipate prolonged blockade; TOF required.

---

## Maintenance Anesthesia (Propofol Spine + Optional Volatile Adjunct)

### Hypnotic Maintenance (All Protocols)
**Primary hypnotic:** **Propofol infusion** (continuous control)

- **Propofol infusion:** **75–125 mcg/kg/min**, titrate to clinical signs and depth monitoring when used.  
- **Sevoflurane (optional adjunct):** may be added at **~0.3–0.5 MAC** to reduce propofol requirement or match workflow; not required in this framework.

> **Attending intent:** Propofol infusion is the stable baseline; sevoflurane, if used, is a supplemental workflow tool—not the primary plan.

### OFIA Adjunct Infusions (Protocols 1 & 2)
(Adjuncts reduce opioid exposure and blunt sympathetic response; none are required for hypnosis.)

| Agent | Protocol 1 Dosing | Protocol 2 Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Dexmedetomidine infusion** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | High-grade AV block (no pacer), severe bradycardia, severe hypotension | Continuous HR/BP; taper 10–15 min before end |
| **Ketamine infusion** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr (optional) | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr (optional) | Active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN; acute globe injury | Do not titrate hypnotic solely to BIS |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Not routine | 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr (optional; institutional protocol) | Severe hepatic impairment, significant conduction disease, amide LA allergy | Monitor toxicity symptoms; lipid available |
| **Magnesium** | Continue if loaded | Continue if loaded | See loading contraindications | TOF vigilance; potentiates NMBD |

---

## Protocol 3 Opioid Strategy (Opioid-Inclusive = Bolus During Induction + Bolus During Maintenance)

**Principle:** Opioids are used as **intermittent boluses** matched to surgical stimulus; avoid late dosing to protect emergence.

| Phase | Fentanyl Strategy | Notes |
|------|--------------------|------|
| **Induction** | **50–100 mcg IV bolus** (typical) | Blunts laryngoscopy/stimulus; reduce in elderly/OSA/frail |
| **Maintenance** | **25–50 mcg IV boluses PRN** | Titrate to stimulus/hemodynamics; avoid late boluses |
| **Late case** | Avoid within ~30 min of emergence | Minimizes delayed wake-up and respiratory depression |

> Continuous fentanyl infusions are not standard for routine rTKA in most settings and increase cumulative exposure; if an institution uses an opioid infusion strategy, it should be written as a separate local protocol with monitoring requirements.

---

## Hemodynamic Management (All Protocols)

| Parameter | Target | First-Line Management | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|------|
| **MAP** | ≥65 mmHg (individualize) | Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg bolus; Ephedrine 5–10 mg bolus if HR <60 | Consider higher MAP targets in chronic HTN/CAD/CVA disease |
| **HR** | 50–100 bpm | Bradycardia: glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV; evaluate depth/meds | Dex-related bradycardia: reduce/stop infusion first |
| **Prophylaxis** | N/A | Consider phenylephrine infusion per institutional practice | Avoid reflex fluid loading; use goal-directed strategy |

---

## Emergence (Controlled Taper + Verification)

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Safety Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Taper infusions** | Taper/stop dex; stop ketamine if used | Taper/stop dex; stop ketamine/lidocaine if used | Stop giving fentanyl boluses | 10–15 min pre-end | Prevent prolonged sedation |
| **Reduce hypnotic** | Taper propofol infusion; sevo optional if used | Same | Same | Skin closure | Avoid abrupt wake-ups; maintain control |
| **Antiemetic** | Ondansetron 4 mg IV | Ondansetron 4 mg IV | Ondansetron 4 mg IV | Before emergence | Especially important with opioid exposure |
| **Reversal** | Sugammadex per TOF | Same | Same | When indicated | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 required** |
| **Extubation criteria** | Awake, commands, adequate ventilation, SpO₂ goal, TOF ≥0.9 | Same | **More stringent** if opioid exposure/OSA/frail | Standard | Delay extubation if any respiratory compromise |

**Protocol 3 emergence note:** If concerning respiratory depression, consider naloxone titration per institutional policy (e.g., small incremental doses).

## Postoperative Pain Management

### Expected Early Pain (0–6 hours PACU)

| Protocol | Expected NRS | Primary driver |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Protocol 1** | 0–3 | ACB/IPACK + multimodal |
| **Protocol 2** | 2–5 | Infiltration quality + multimodal |
| **Protocol 3** | 2–6 | Variable; opioid kinetics + multimodal |

### Scheduled Multimodal (All Protocols)

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Max Daily | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg | q6h | 3 g/day hepatic impairment; 4 g/day otherwise | Reduce if <50 kg |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg | q12h | 400 mg/day | Avoid: CrCl <30, active bleed, recent CV event |
| **Ketorolac (alt)** | 15 mg IV | q6h | 60 mg/day; ≤5 days | Use caution in elderly/renal/GI risk |
| **Meloxicam (alt)** | 7.5–15 mg | daily | 15 mg/day | NSAID precautions apply |

### Rescue Analgesia (Conservative)

| Protocol | First-Line | Dosing | Second-Line | Monitoring |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| **1** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min, reassess each dose | Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV if institutional protocol | Continuous pulse ox |
| **2** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min | Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV if allowed | Continuous pulse ox |
| **3** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (very cautious) | Reassess multimodal before escalating | **Mandatory continuous pulse ox; consider capnography** |

---

## Safety Monitoring Requirements

### Intraoperative (All Protocols)
- ASA standard monitors: ECG, SpO₂, EtCO₂, BP, temperature
- **TOF monitoring mandatory** when NMBD used
- Consider processed EEG in elderly/frail to avoid excessive depth

### PACU / Postoperative
| Monitoring | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Continuous pulse oximetry** | Standard | Standard | **Mandatory until fully awake/stable** |
| **Capnography** | Consider if OSA/high-risk | Consider if OSA/high-risk | **Strongly recommended** in OSA/elderly/opioid-naïve/high exposure |
| **Sedation scoring** | q15 min initially | q15 min initially | q10–15 min with low threshold to escalate |
| **Naloxone readiness** | Routine availability | Routine availability | Bedside-ready per institutional practice |
| **LAST preparedness** | Lipid available if blocks | N/A | Lipid if blocks |

---

## Contraindications and Safety Considerations (High-Yield)

### Protocol 1 Avoid When
- Block contraindications: refusal, infection/sepsis, anticoagulation outside ASRA/institutional window, amide LA anaphylaxis
- OFIA adjunct contraindications: ketamine (active psychosis), dex (high-grade AV block/no pacer), magnesium (CrCl <30/MG/heart block)

### Protocol 2 Avoid When
- Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated or institutional resources do not support OFIA monitoring/titration

### Protocol 3 Avoid When Possible In
- Severe OSA, frail elderly, baseline cognitive impairment/delirium history, prior respiratory failure, severe PONV history
- If used: lowest effective opioids + enhanced monitoring + low threshold for monitored bed

### Postoperative Restart (Single-shot blocks)
- DOACs/Dabigatran: ≥6 h (often longer per institutional policy)
- Prophylactic LMWH: ≥6–12 h (commonly 12 h)
- Therapeutic LMWH: ≥24 h

**Documentation minimum:** last dose time, CrCl, and institutional compliance check.

## Key Clinical Pearls (Attending-Style)

1. **Propofol bolus induces unconsciousness; propofol infusion maintains hypnosis** across all pathways.  
2. **Induction is bolus-based; maintenance is infusion-based** for stable control.  
3. **Protocol 1** is first-line when feasible: best early analgesia and lowest opioid exposure.  
4. **Protocol 2** preserves opioid-sparing strategy when blocks are not possible.  
5. **Protocol 3** uses fentanyl as **bolus at induction** and **bolus PRN during maintenance**, with enhanced monitoring and conservative totals.  
6. Avoid late opioids; **taper infusions 10–15 minutes before end** to protect wake-up.  
7. **TOF ≥0.9 is non-negotiable** before extubation.  
8. Treat emergence as a high-risk phase: extubate only when ventilation and alertness are unequivocal.

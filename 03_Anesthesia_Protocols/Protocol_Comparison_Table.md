# rTKA Anesthesia Protocol Comparison Table

Quick reference comparing three evidence-based anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). All protocols reflect conservative, safety-first dosing with mandatory individualization.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses represent conservative starting points requiring titration to physiologic response.  
> - Institutional protocols and attending anesthesiologist judgment supersede all recommendations.  
> - Special populations require additional dose reduction and monitoring intensification.

## Attending Validation Summary
### (What This Table Is Designed to Produce When Applied Correctly)

This comparison table is structured to match the attending anesthesiologist’s real-world decision model:

1. **Induction is reliable:** loss of consciousness is achieved predictably with a **propofol IV bolus** (with indicated co-boluses), supporting consistent airway conditions.  
2. **Maintenance is controllable:** unconsciousness is maintained with a continuous hypnotic strategy (propofol infusion and/or age-adjusted volatile anesthetic), with adjuncts modulating analgesia and sympathetic tone rather than serving as primary hypnosis.
3. **Physiology is actively managed:** hemodynamic targets, vasoactive rescue strategy, neuromuscular blockade monitoring, and depth considerations are explicit and proactive.  
4. **Emergence is protected:** infusions are tapered in advance, late opioids are avoided, **TOF ≥ 0.9** is confirmed, and extubation criteria are risk-stratified.

---

## Universal Workflow Principles
### (Applied Across All Three Protocols)

These principles reflect common attending practice patterns and are intentionally phrased as defaults (not absolutes).

### Induction: Bolus-Dominant Strategy
- Induction is typically bolus-driven to achieve rapid, reliable loss of consciousness and airway conditions.
- A **propofol IV bolus** is the default hypnotic event for induction in this framework.
- Adjunct boluses (e.g., fentanyl in opioid-inclusive pathways, ketamine when indicated) are used to blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, not to replace hypnosis.

### Maintenance: Continuous Delivery Strategy
- Maintenance is typically infusion- or continuous-delivery–based to avoid depth oscillation and maintain physiologic stability.
- **Propofol infusion** serves as the default hypnotic spine in this framework.
- Volatile agent (e.g., sevoflurane) may be used as an optional adjunct per workflow or institutional practice; it is not required.

### Emergence: Planned Taper and Verification
- Emergence is treated as a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning.
- Hypnotic and adjunct infusions are tapered 10–15 minutes prior to anticipated end of surgery.
- Avoid late opioids when feasible.
- Confirm **TOF ≥ 0.9** and meet extubation criteria prior to airway removal.

| **First-line choice?** | **Preferred first-line** when blocks feasible and safe | Preferred when blocks contraindicated/refused | Reserved for when OFIA inappropriate or contraindicated |
| **Anticoagulation timing** | Must meet **ASRA + institutional** requirements for deep peripheral blocks | **Any timing** (no blocks) | **Any timing** if no blocks; ASRA timing if blocks used |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Strongly preferred** (opioid-sparing + regional) | **Strongly preferred** over opioid pathway | **Avoid if possible**; if required: mandatory continuous monitoring + conservative dosing |
| **Elderly/frail (>75 or frailty)** | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Avoid if possible**; high delirium/respiratory risk |
| **Chronic opioid use** | Appropriate; continue home regimen | Appropriate; continue home regimen | Appropriate; anticipate tolerance |
| **Patient refuses blocks** | Not applicable | **Preferred** | Alternative |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic management | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic management | Often preferred if dexmedetomidine contraindicated |

## Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Aligned)

| Medication | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 60–90 min pre-op | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 1–2 hrs pre-op | Contraindicated: CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | After IV access | Consider 4–6 mg if diabetic; monitor glucose |
| **Scopolamine patch** | 1.5 mg transdermal | 1.5 mg transdermal | 1.5 mg transdermal | Evening prior or ≥4 hrs pre-op | High PONV risk only; contraindicated in glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | Holding area | **Reduce to 0.5 mg or avoid** in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** | N/A | Delirium/sedation risk outweighs benefit in modern multimodal protocols |
| **Home opioids** | Continue at baseline dose | Continue at baseline dose | Continue at baseline dose | Morning of surgery | Do not escalate pre-op |

---

## Regional Analgesia

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Adductor Canal Block (ACB)** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **IPACK** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **Total ropivacaine dose** | **80 mg** (well below 3 mg/kg for most adults) | N/A | 80 mg if blocks performed |
| **ASRA anticoagulation compliance** | **Mandatory** | N/A | **Mandatory if blocks performed** |
| **20% lipid emulsion** | **Must be immediately available** | N/A | **Must be immediately available if blocks** |
| **LAST treatment protocol** | Visible and rehearsed | N/A | Visible and rehearsed if blocks |
| **Expected analgesic duration** | 12–18 hours | N/A | 12–18 hours if blocks |
| **Motor preservation** | Quadriceps-sparing intent | N/A | Quadriceps-sparing intent if blocks |

**Conservative ropivacaine dosing rationale:**
- 0.2% concentration provides effective analgesia with lower toxicity risk than 0.25–0.5%
- Total 80 mg remains well below toxic threshold (~200 mg for 70 kg adult)
- Document all local anesthetic sources (blocks + surgeon infiltration)

---

## Induction (Conservative Adult Dosing)

> **Lidocaine note:** 20–40 mg IV (0.5 mg/kg) immediately before propofol reduces injection pain. This is **separate** from systemic lidocaine infusion.

| Agent | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) | Special Population Adjustments |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Midazolam** | 0–1 mg IV (often omit if already given) | 0–1 mg IV | 0–1 mg IV | **Age >75/frail/OSA:** 0.5 mg maximum or avoid |
| **Lidocaine (injection pain)** | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | Optional; not required |
| **Propofol** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **Age >75/frail/cardiac:** 1–1.5 mg/kg; titrate slowly |
| **Ketamine (adjunct)** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2 mg/kg IV (optional; rarely needed) | **Age >75/frail:** 0.2 mg/kg maximum or omit |
| **Fentanyl** | **None** (OFIA principle) | **None** (OFIA principle) | **50–100 mcg IV** (1–1.5 mcg/kg) | **Age >75/OSA/opioid-naïve:** start 25–50 mcg |
| **Rocuronium** | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | Dose to ideal body weight in obesity; TOF monitoring mandatory |
| **Dexmedetomidine loading** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** | Bolus dosing increases bradycardia/hypotension risk |
| **Magnesium loading** | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | **Not routine** | **Contraindicated:** CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, heart block |

**Critical safety notes:**
- Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension; ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue (e.g., phenylephrine or ephedrine) per institutional practice.
- Ketamine contraindicated in active psychosis, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180)
- Magnesium potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate prolonged paralysis

## Maintenance Anesthesia

### Hypnotic Maintenance (All Protocols)

**Primary options** (select based on clinical factors and workflow):

| Option | Dosing | Advantages | Disadvantages | Preferred When |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Propofol TIVA** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to depth monitors) | Antiemetic properties; precise control; MH-safe | Requires dedicated IV; propofol infusion syndrome risk if prolonged (>48h at high dose) | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; precise depth control desired |
| **Sevoflurane** | **0.7–1 MAC** (age-adjusted) | Familiar; easy titration; rapid offset | PONV risk higher than propofol; requires volatile-capable machine | Standard workflow; not high PONV risk |
| **Balanced (both)** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + Sevoflurane 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce total dose of each | More complex titration | Institutional preference or specific clinical scenarios |

**Age-adjusted MAC reduction:**
- Age 65–75: reduce by ~20%
- Age 75–85: reduce by ~30–40%
- Age >85: reduce by ~40–50%

### OFIA Adjuncts (Protocols 1 & 2)

| Agent | Protocol 1 Dosing | Protocol 2 Dosing | Contraindications | Monitoring |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr (infusion only; no bolus) | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr (infusion only; no bolus) | High-grade AV block without pacer; severe bradycardia (HR <50); severe hypotension | Continuous HR/BP; stop if HR <50 with symptoms or <45 regardless |
| **Ketamine infusion** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr (optional) | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr (optional) | Active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN (SBP >180); acute globe injury | Avoid using BIS alone for depth (ketamine increases BIS) |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | **Not routine** | 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr (optional; institutional protocol) | Severe hepatic impairment; complete heart block; amide LA allergy; severe cardiac conduction disease | Monitor for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, confusion); lipid 20% available |
| **Magnesium** | Continue at maintenance rate if loaded | Continue at maintenance rate if loaded | See loading contraindications | Anticipate prolonged neuromuscular blockade |

**Dexmedetomidine safety:**
- **Elderly/frail dosing:** 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum
- **Stop/reduce:** 10–15 minutes before end of case to prevent prolonged sedation
- **Bradycardia management:** Reduce/stop infusion first; glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic

**Ketamine safety:**
- **Elderly/frail dosing:** 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or omit
- **BIS monitoring caveat:** Ketamine dissociates cortical activity; do not titrate hypnotic solely to BIS
- Lower doses in hemodynamically fragile patients

### Opioid Strategy (Protocol 3 Only)

**Conservative intermittent bolus approach** (NOT continuous infusion):

| Phase | Fentanyl Dosing | Monitoring | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| **Induction** | 50–100 mcg IV (see induction table) | Standard ASA monitors | Reduce to 25–50 mcg in elderly/OSA/frail |
| **Maintenance** | **25–50 mcg IV boluses** titrated to surgical stimulus and hemodynamics | Continuous monitoring; assess respiratory rate if spontaneous ventilation | **Total typical case:** 150–250 mcg (opioid-naïve)<br>May require more in opioid-tolerant |
| **Timing** | Avoid administration within 30 minutes of anticipated emergence | Prepare for potential delayed emergence | Consider shorter-acting opioid (remifentanil) in very high-risk patients per institutional protocol |

**Why NOT continuous fentanyl infusion for routine TKA:**
- Continuous infusions are **not standard practice** for routine orthopedic cases
- Increases cumulative dose and respiratory depression risk
- Less responsive to changing surgical stimulus
- Reserved for: ICU sedation, palliative care, or specific high-tolerance scenarios

**If continuous infusion is genuinely indicated** (rare):
- Maximum 0.5–1 mcg/kg/hr (NOT 2 mcg/kg/hr)
- Document clear clinical indication
- Mandatory continuous capnography
- Enhanced PACU monitoring plan

---

## Hemodynamic Management (All Protocols)

| Parameter | Target | First-Line Management | Special Considerations |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Mean Arterial Pressure** | ≥65 mmHg (individualize to baseline and comorbidities) | Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV (if HR adequate)<br>Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV (if HR <60) | **Chronic HTN baseline SBP >160:** consider MAP target >70–75 mmHg<br>**CAD/cerebrovascular disease:** maintain closer to baseline |
| **Heart Rate** | 50–100 bpm | **Bradycardia (HR <50):** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV<br>**Tachycardia (HR >100):** Assess etiology (pain, light anesthesia, volume status) | If dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia: reduce/stop infusion first |
| **Hypotension prophylaxis** | N/A | Consider phenylephrine infusion (20–50 mcg/min) in severe cardiac disease or predicted lability | Avoid aggressive fluid boluses; goal-directed fluid therapy |

---

## Emergence

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Safety Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Taper adjuncts** | Stop/reduce dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine if used | Stop/reduce dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine and lidocaine if used | Discontinue fentanyl administration | 10–15 min before anticipated end | Prevents prolonged sedation |
| **Hypnotic reduction** | Taper propofol or reduce sevoflurane | Taper propofol or reduce sevoflurane | Taper propofol or reduce sevoflurane | At skin closure | Titrate to spontaneous ventilation and awareness |
| **Ondansetron** | 4 mg IV | 4 mg IV | 4 mg IV | Before emergence | **Critical in Protocol 3** due to opioid exposure |
| **Neuromuscular reversal** | Sugammadex 2 mg/kg (TOF count ≥2) or 4 mg/kg (deep block) | Same | Same | When TOF monitoring shows blockade | **Mandatory TOF ratio ≥0.9** before extubation |
| **Extubation criteria** | Awake, following commands, adequate TV (≥5 mL/kg), RR 10–20, SpO₂ ≥95%, TOF ≥0.9 | Same | **More stringent:** Fully awake, minimal somnolence, robust ventilation (TV ≥6–8 mL/kg, RR 12–20), sustained head lift | Standard | **Protocol 3:** Lower threshold to delay extubation in OSA/elderly/high opioid exposure |

**Protocol 3 emergence safety:**
- Anticipate delayed, potentially prolonged emergence
- **Do NOT extubate** if any somnolence or respiratory depression
- Consider reversal agent availability (naloxone 0.04–0.08 mg IV titrated) if concerning

## Postoperative Pain Management

### Expected Early Pain (0–6 hours PACU)

| Protocol | Expected NRS (0–10) | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks)** | 0–3 | Excellent analgesia from ACB + IPACK; minimal rescue typically needed |
| **Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free)** | 2–5 | More variable; dependent on surgeon infiltration quality and systemic multimodal |
| **Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive)** | 2–6 | Variable; may have residual opioid effect early, but higher scores possible as wears off |

### Scheduled Multimodal (All Protocols)

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Contraindications/Cautions |
|------------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg PO/IV | Every 6 hours | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment)<br>4 g/day (normal liver) | Reduce dose <50 kg; avoid if severe hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg PO | Every 12 hours | 400 mg/day | **Avoid:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent CV event, aspirin allergy |
| **Ketorolac** (alternative) | 15 mg IV | Every 6 hours | 60 mg/day; max 5 days | **Avoid:** Age >65, CrCl <50, bleeding risk, GI disease; conservative dosing preferred |
| **Meloxicam** (alternative) | 7.5–15 mg PO | Once daily | 15 mg/day | Similar NSAID precautions |

**NSAID decision-making:**
- **Strong benefit** when safe: reduce opioid requirement significantly
- **High caution required:** elderly, renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, concurrent anticoagulation
- Consider **selective COX-2 (celecoxib)** over ketorolac in higher-risk patients

### Rescue Analgesia (Conservative Approach)

| Protocol | First-Line Rescue | Dosing | Second-Line | Monitoring Requirements |
|----------|------------------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Protocol 1** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV every 15–20 min (reassess after each dose) | Ketamine 10–20 mg IV (0.1–0.15 mg/kg) if institutional protocol allows | Standard PACU; continuous pulse oximetry |
| **Protocol 2** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV every 15–20 min (reassess after each dose) | Ketamine 10–20 mg IV (0.1–0.15 mg/kg) if institutional protocol allows | Standard PACU; continuous pulse oximetry; expect higher rescue needs |
| **Protocol 3** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV every 15–20 min (titrate very carefully) | Reassess multimodal before escalating | **Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry**; consider capnography in high-risk |

**Elderly/frail/OSA rescue dosing:**
- Hydromorphone: **0.2 mg IV** starting dose
- **Longer reassessment intervals:** 20–30 minutes
- Lower threshold to consider non-opioid alternatives

**Ketamine as rescue analgesia:**
- Institutional variability; not universally adopted
- Typical dose: 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV (7–10 mg for 70 kg)
- Maximum ~3 doses per clinical reassessment
- Contraindications apply (psychosis, severe HTN)

|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pain control (0–24h)** | Excellent (NRS typically 0–3) | Good (NRS typically 2–5) | Variable (NRS 2–6) |
| **PONV incidence** | Low (~10–20%) | Low–Moderate (~15–30%) | Higher (~30–50%) |
| **Sedation/drowsiness** | Minimal | Minimal–Moderate | Moderate–High; may be prolonged |
| **Time to mobilization** | Early (often 4–6 hrs post-op) | Early (often 4–8 hrs post-op) | Often delayed (sedation/PONV barriers) |
| **Delirium risk (elderly)** | Lower | Lower | Higher (multifactorial) |
| **Respiratory events** | Lower | Lower | Higher (dose-dependent) |
| **PACU length of stay** | Shorter | Similar | Often longer |
| **Patient satisfaction** | High | Moderate–High | Variable |

---

## Safety Monitoring Requirements

### Intraoperative (All Protocols)

**Standard ASA monitors:**
- Continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, capnography, blood pressure (every 3–5 min or continuous arterial line if indicated)
- Temperature monitoring
- **Neuromuscular monitoring (TOF):** Mandatory for all protocols using NMBD

**Additional monitoring considerations:**
- **Processed EEG (BIS/entropy):** Consider in elderly/frail to avoid excessive depth
- **Arterial line:** Severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability

### PACU/Postoperative

| Monitoring Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Continuous pulse oximetry** | Standard (minimum 1 hour) | Standard (minimum 1–2 hours) | **Mandatory continuous** until fully awake and stable |
| **Capnography** | Consider if OSA or other high-risk features | Consider if OSA or other high-risk features | **Strongly recommended** for OSA/elderly/opioid-naïve/high opioid exposure |
| **Sedation scale** | Every 15 min initially | Every 15 min initially | **Every 10–15 min** with low threshold for escalation |
| **Pain assessment** | Every 15–30 min | Every 15–30 min | Every 15–30 min |
| **Naloxone availability** | Prepared per routine | Prepared per routine | **Immediately available** at bedside; low threshold for use |
| **LAST preparedness** | **20% lipid emulsion immediately available** | Not applicable (no blocks) | **20% lipid emulsion immediately available** if blocks performed |

### Floor Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**All protocols:**
- Vital signs every 4 hours minimum
- Pain assessment with vitals
- Sedation assessment

**Protocol 3 additional requirements:**
- Consider continuous pulse oximetry for high-risk patients (OSA, elderly, significant opioid exposure)
- Enhanced respiratory monitoring protocols per institutional policy
- Lower threshold for ICU/step-down bed if concerning features

---

## ASRA/ESRA Anticoagulation Timing (2024–2025)

**Applies to:** Deep peripheral nerve blocks (ACB, IPACK) in Protocols 1 and 3

> **Critical:** This table provides **general guidance only**. Always consult:
> 1. Current ASRA/ESRA guidelines (updated regularly)
> 2. **Institutional anticoagulation management protocols** (supersede general guidance)
> 3. Verify patient-specific factors: renal function, actual vs labeled dosing, drug-drug interactions

### Preoperative Holds (Time Before Block)

| Anticoagulant | Normal Renal Function (CrCl >50) | Renal Impairment (CrCl 30–50) | Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl <30) | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| **DOACs** (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) | ≥72 hours | ≥96 hours | ≥120 hours | Verify last dose timing; consider drug levels if available |
| **Dabigatran** | ≥72 hours | ≥96 hours | ≥120 hours | Most renally dependent DOAC; longer holds in renal impairment |
| **Warfarin** | Until INR ≤1.4 (verify day of procedure) | Same | Same | Check INR morning of procedure |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID) | ≥24 hours | ≥24 hours | Consult hematology | Higher bleeding risk than prophylactic |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** (enoxaparin 40 mg daily) | ≥12 hours | ≥12 hours | ≥24 hours recommended | Most common VTE prophylaxis regimen |
| **Unfractionated heparin (prophylactic)** | 4–6 hours | 4–6 hours | 4–6 hours | Check aPTT if therapeutic dosing |
| **Aspirin (≤325 mg daily)** | **No hold required** | **No hold required** | **No hold required** | Per ASRA: acceptable for peripheral blocks |
| **Clopidogrel** | 5–7 days (institutional variability) | 5–7 days | 5–7 days | **Many institutions require hold despite permissive ASRA guidance**; verify local policy |
| **NSAIDs** | **No hold required** | **No hold required** | **No hold required** | Acceptable for peripheral blocks |

### Postoperative Restart Timing (Time After Block/Catheter Removal)

| Anticoagulant | Minimum Time After Block | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **DOACs** | ≥6 hours (single-injection block) | May require longer delay per institutional protocol |
| **Dabigatran** | ≥6 hours | Same considerations as other DOACs |
| **Warfarin** | Per medicine/surgical team plan | Usually initiated evening of surgery or POD1 |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24 hours | High bleeding risk; verify with surgical team |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥6–12 hours (institutional variability) | Most common: 12 hours post-block |
| **Aspirin** | Immediate (continue) | No hold required |
| **Clopidogrel** | Per institutional protocol | Typically resume per cardiology guidance |
| **NSAIDs** | Immediate (continue) | No hold required |

**Documentation requirements:**
- Last anticoagulant dose and timing
- Renal function (creatinine clearance calculation)
- Institutional anticoagulation protocol compliance verification
- Risk-benefit discussion if proceeding outside standard windows

## Key Clinical Pearls

### General Principles
1. **Propofol induction (1.5–2 mg/kg) is standard across all protocols** – reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg in elderly/frail/severe cardiac disease
2. **Regional analgesia (Protocol 1) provides superior early pain control** – strongly preferred when safe and feasible
3. **OFIA pathways (Protocols 1 & 2) reduce respiratory complications** – especially critical in OSA and elderly populations
4. **Avoid continuous fentanyl infusions for routine TKA** – intermittent bolus titration is standard practice

### Dosing Safety
5. **Conservative initial dosing in special populations** – elderly, frail, OSA, severe cardiac disease all require dose reduction
6. **Dexmedetomidine: infusion-first strategy** – avoid bolus loading (increases bradycardia/hypotension risk)
7. **Magnesium potentiates neuromuscular blockade** – anticipate longer paralysis; mandatory TOF monitoring
8. **Ketamine alters BIS/EEG** – do not titrate hypnotic depth solely to processed EEG when using ketamine

### Monitoring
9. **TOF monitoring is mandatory** – for all protocols using neuromuscular blockade; confirm ratio ≥0.9 before extubation
10. **Enhanced PACU monitoring for Protocol 3** – continuous pulse oximetry mandatory; consider capnography in high-risk
11. **LAST preparedness is non-negotiable** – 20% lipid emulsion immediately available whenever regional blocks performed

### Pathway Selection
12. **Protocol 1 is first-line when feasible** – best early analgesia, opioid-sparing, ERAS-aligned
13. **Protocol 2 when blocks contraindicated** – maintains opioid-sparing benefits without regional techniques
14. **Protocol 3 reserved for specific indications** – use when OFIA inappropriate or contraindicated; requires enhanced monitoring

### Emergence and Recovery
15. **Taper adjuncts 10–15 minutes before end** – prevents prolonged sedation and delayed emergence
16. **Lower threshold to delay extubation in Protocol 3** – especially with OSA, elderly, or high opioid exposure
17. **Early mobilization is the goal** – Protocols 1 and 2 typically support POD 0 ambulation when safe

**Governance Statement:**  
This document is an educational perioperative anesthesia framework intended to support structured clinical reasoning and multidisciplinary discussion. It does not supersede institutional policy, order sets, anticoagulation guidance, pharmacy restrictions, credentialing/privileging requirements, or attending anesthesiologist judgment. When conflicts arise, institutional governance and patient-specific risk assessment prevail.

**Governance Lock:**  
This document intentionally avoids prescribing institution-specific order sets, mandated dosing, or hard monitoring thresholds. Any operational implementation requires anesthesia department approval, pharmacy review, nursing workflow validation, and explicit alignment with institutional opioid stewardship and postoperative monitoring policies.

Quick reference comparing three evidence-informed anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). All pathways prioritize conservative starting doses, physiologic titration, and phenotype-based monitoring intensification.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**
> - All doses represent conservative starting ranges and require titration to physiologic effect and monitoring data.
> - Attending anesthesiologist judgment and local protocols supersede this framework.
> - Special populations (elderly/frail, OSA/OHS, severe cardiac disease, renal/hepatic impairment, chronic opioid therapy) require dose reduction and monitoring escalation.

## Attending Validation Summary
### Intended Clinical Output When Applied Correctly

This comparison table is structured to match the attending anesthesiologist’s pragmatic decision model:

1. **Induction is reliable:** loss of consciousness is achieved predictably with a **propofol IV bolus** (with indicated co-boluses) to produce consistent airway conditions.  
2. **Maintenance is controllable:** unconsciousness is maintained by a continuous hypnotic strategy (propofol infusion and/or age-adjusted volatile anesthetic). Adjuncts modulate analgesia and sympathetic tone; they do not replace hypnosis.  
3. **Physiology is managed proactively:** hemodynamic targets, vasoactive rescue strategy, neuromuscular blockade monitoring, and depth management are explicit and anticipatory.  
4. **Emergence is protected:** infusions are tapered with intent, opioid stacking near extubation is avoided, **TOF ratio ≥ 0.9** is confirmed, and extubation criteria are risk-stratified.

---

## Universal Workflow Principles
### Applied Across All Three Pathways

These principles reflect common attending practice patterns and are written as defaults—not absolutes.

### Induction: Bolus-Dominant Strategy
- Induction is typically bolus-driven to achieve rapid, reliable loss of consciousness and airway conditions.
- A **propofol IV bolus** is the default hypnotic event in this framework.
- Adjunct boluses (e.g., fentanyl in opioid-inclusive pathways, ketamine when indicated) are used to attenuate sympathetic response and support analgesia, not to replace hypnosis.

### Maintenance: Continuous-Delivery Strategy
- Maintenance is typically infusion- or continuous-delivery–based to reduce depth oscillation and stabilize physiology.
- **Propofol infusion** is the default hypnotic spine when TIVA is selected.
- Volatile agent (e.g., sevoflurane) may be used as an alternative or adjunct depending on workflow and institutional practice.

### Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity
**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by one of the following (or a balanced combination):**
- **Propofol TIVA:** 75–150 mcg/kg/min (typical 75–125; higher end phenotype/workflow-dependent)  
**and/or**
- **Sevoflurane:** ~0.7–1.0 MAC (age-adjusted)

**OFIA adjuncts are additive, not substitutive:**
- Dexmedetomidine: sedation and sympatholysis (not surgical hypnosis)
- Ketamine (low-dose): analgesia and dissociation (not reliably sufficient for unconsciousness)
- Lidocaine and magnesium: analgesia/anti-hyperalgesia (not hypnosis)

**Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness.**

### Emergence: Planned Taper and Verification
- Emergence is treated as a safety-critical phase requiring explicit planning.
- Taper hypnotic/adjunct infusions approximately **10–15 minutes** prior to anticipated end of surgery (case- and phenotype-dependent).
- Avoid late-case opioid stacking when feasible.
- Confirm extubation criteria and **TOF ratio ≥ 0.9** prior to airway removal.

## Protocol Selection Guide
### Which Analgesic Strategy Fits the Patient?

| Patient Factor | Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **First-line choice** | **Preferred** when blocks feasible and safe | Preferred when blocks contraindicated/refused | Reserved when OFIA is inappropriate/contraindicated or per shared decision-making |
| **Anticoagulation timing** | Must meet **ASRA + institutional** requirements for deep peripheral blocks | Any timing (no blocks) | Any timing if no blocks; ASRA/institutional timing if blocks used |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Strongly preferred** (opioid-sparing + regional) | **Strongly preferred** over opioid pathway | Avoid if possible; if used: conservative dosing + enhanced monitoring |
| **Elderly/frail** | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | Avoid if possible; higher delirium/respiratory event risk |
| **Chronic opioid therapy** | Appropriate; continue baseline regimen | Appropriate; continue baseline regimen | Appropriate; anticipate tolerance and higher postoperative requirements |
| **Patient refuses blocks** | Not applicable | **Preferred** | Alternative |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic strategy | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic strategy | May be preferred if dexmedetomidine is contraindicated |
| **High-grade AV block / baseline bradycardia** | Dexmedetomidine often contraindicated | Dexmedetomidine often contraindicated | May be preferred option |
| **Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30)** | Avoid magnesium; adjust renally cleared meds | Avoid magnesium; adjust renally cleared meds | Adjust renally cleared medications |
| **Active psychosis** | Ketamine contraindicated | Ketamine contraindicated | May be preferred option |

---

## Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Aligned)

| Medication | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 60–90 min pre-op | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 1–2 hrs pre-op | Avoid/contraindicate per institutional policy: CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | After IV access | Consider 4–6 mg if diabetic; monitor glucose per protocol |
| **Scopolamine patch** | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | Evening prior or ≥4 hrs pre-op | High PONV-risk phenotype; avoid in narrow-angle glaucoma; anticholinergic delirium risk in frail elderly |
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | Holding area | **Reduce to 0.5 mg or omit** in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | N/A | Sedation/delirium risk often outweighs incremental benefit in modern multimodal pathways |
| **Home opioids** | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Morning of surgery | Do not escalate pre-op; coordinate with chronic pain plan if present |

---

## Regional Analgesia (Protocols 1 and optional in 3)

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Adductor Canal Block (ACB)** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **IPACK** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **Total ropivacaine dose** | **80 mg** (typically well below 3 mg/kg in most adults) | N/A | 80 mg if blocks performed |
| **ASRA/institution anticoagulation compliance** | **Mandatory** | N/A | **Mandatory if blocks performed** |
| **LAST preparedness** | **20% lipid emulsion immediately available**; protocol visible | N/A | Same if blocks performed |
| **Expected analgesic duration** | ~12–18 hours (variable) | N/A | ~12–18 hours if blocks performed |
| **Motor preservation intent** | Quadriceps-sparing approach | N/A | Same if blocks performed |

**Conservative ropivacaine dosing rationale:**
- 0.2% concentration supports analgesia with lower toxicity risk than higher concentrations.
- Total dose should be interpreted in context of *all* local anesthetic sources (blocks + surgeon infiltration).
- Institutional maximum dose policies and patient-specific risk factors (age, frailty, hepatic disease, low body mass) supersede typical thresholds.

## Induction (Conservative Adult Dosing)

> **Lidocaine note (injection pain):** 20–40 mg IV (~0.5 mg/kg) immediately before propofol may reduce injection pain. This is distinct from systemic lidocaine infusion protocols.

| Agent | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) | Special Population Adjustments |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Midazolam** | 0–1 mg IV (often omit if already given) | 0–1 mg IV | 0–1 mg IV | **Age >75/frail/OSA:** 0.5 mg max or omit |
| **Lidocaine (injection pain)** | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | Optional; omit if not needed |
| **Propofol** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **Age >75/frail/severe cardiac disease:** 1–1.5 mg/kg; slow titration |
| **Ketamine (adjunct)** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV (optional) | **Elderly/frail:** 0.1–0.2 mg/kg or omit |
| **Fentanyl** | None (OFIA principle) | None (OFIA principle) | **25–100 mcg IV** (titrate) | **Age >75/OSA/opioid-naïve:** start 25–50 mcg |
| **Rocuronium** | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | Dose to IBW/AdjBW in obesity; **TOF monitoring mandatory** |
| **Dexmedetomidine bolus** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | Bolus increases bradycardia/hypotension risk |
| **Magnesium loading** | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | Not routine | Avoid in CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced heart block; potentiates NMBD |

**Critical safety notes:**
- Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension; ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue per institutional practice.
- Ketamine is relatively contraindicated in active psychosis; avoid in severe uncontrolled hypertension per clinician judgment.
- Magnesium potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate longer paralysis and ensure quantitative TOF monitoring.

## Maintenance Anesthesia
**All protocols require continuous propofol and/or volatile anesthesia (see “Hypnotic Continuity”).**

### Hypnotic Maintenance (All Protocols)

| Option | Dosing (typical) | Advantages | Limitations | Preferred When |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Propofol TIVA** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to effect/monitoring) | Antiemetic; precise titration; MH-safe | Requires reliable IV access; prolonged high-dose infusions are not routine | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; depth control prioritized |
| **Sevoflurane** | **~0.7–1.0 MAC** (age-adjusted) | Familiar workflow; rapid titration | Higher PONV risk vs propofol | Standard workflow; IV access limitations; institutional preference |
| **Balanced technique** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + sevo 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce dose of each agent | More complex titration | Select scenarios per clinician/institution preference |

**Age-adjusted MAC (directional guidance):**
- 65–75: reduce ~20%
- 75–85: reduce ~30–40%
- >85: reduce ~40–50%

### OFIA Adjuncts (Protocols 1 & 2)

| Agent | Protocol 1 Dosing | Protocol 2 Dosing | Key Contraindications/Precautions | Monitoring Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Dexmedetomidine (infusion only)** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | High-grade AV block (no pacer), symptomatic bradycardia, hypotension | Continuous HR/BP; reduce/stop for bradycardia/hypotension |
| **Ketamine infusion (optional)** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr | Active psychosis; avoid in severe uncontrolled HTN per judgment | Ketamine may elevate BIS; avoid titrating hypnosis to BIS alone |
| **Lidocaine infusion (optional; institutional protocol)** | Not routine | 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr | Severe hepatic dysfunction, significant conduction disease, amide allergy | Monitor for CNS toxicity; follow institutional policy |
| **Magnesium (if loaded)** | Continue per local protocol | Continue per local protocol | CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced AV block | Potentiates NMBD; ensure quantitative TOF |

**Dexmedetomidine practice notes:**
- Elderly/frail: typically 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr.
- Taper/stop ~10–15 minutes prior to end of case to reduce prolonged sedation.
- Bradycardia strategy: reduce/stop infusion first; treat symptoms per clinician judgment and institutional practice.

**Ketamine practice notes:**
- Elderly/frail: often 0.1 mg/kg/hr max or omit.
- BIS caveat: ketamine can increase processed EEG indices; interpret in clinical context.

### Opioid Strategy (Protocol 3 Only)

**Core principle:** opioid-inclusive does not mean opioid-heavy. Prefer conservative dosing, early taper, and avoid late stacking.

**Intraoperative options (choose one approach; avoid mixing high-dose boluses + continuous infusion late in case):**
- **Bolus-first (preferred for most):** fentanyl 25–50 mcg increments titrated to stimulus and physiology  
- **Low-rate infusion (select cases):** fentanyl ~0.5–1.0 mcg/kg/hr with **planned taper/stop 20–30 minutes before emergence** (earlier in OSA/elderly/frail/opioid-naïve)

**End-of-case planning (avoid near-extubation stacking):**
- Hydromorphone **0.2–0.6 mg IV total** in small increments with reassessment  
  - OSA/elderly/frail: start **0.2 mg** and reassess longer

**Operational safety controls (Protocol 3):**
- Avoid late-case opioid stacking (primary emergence safety control).
- Ensure an explicit PACU respiratory monitoring plan for high-risk phenotypes (consider capnography where available).

## Hemodynamic Management (All Protocols)

| Parameter | Target | First-Line Management | Special Considerations |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **MAP** | ≥65 mmHg (individualize to baseline/comorbidity) | Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV (if HR adequate) / Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV (if HR low) | Chronic HTN, CAD, cerebrovascular disease: consider closer-to-baseline perfusion targets |
| **HR** | ~50–100 bpm (phenotype-dependent) | Bradycardia: evaluate etiology; treat per clinician judgment (e.g., anticholinergic if symptomatic) | If dexmedetomidine-related: reduce/stop infusion first |
| **Hypotension prevention** | N/A | Consider low-dose vasopressor infusion in predicted lability per institutional practice | Avoid indiscriminate fluid loading; use goal-directed strategy when available |

---

## Emergence

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Safety Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Taper adjuncts** | Reduce/stop dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine if used | Reduce/stop dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine/lidocaine if used | Stop opioid delivery; avoid late boluses | ~10–15 min before end | Prevent prolonged sedation/respiratory depression |
| **Hypnotic reduction** | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Skin closure → dressing | Titrate to ventilation and wakefulness |
| **Antiemetic** | Ondansetron 4 mg IV (typical) | Same | Same | Prior to emergence | Particularly important in opioid exposure |
| **NMBD reversal** | Sugammadex 2 mg/kg (TOF count ≥2) or 4 mg/kg (deep block) | Same | Same | Based on quantitative TOF | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 required** |
| **Extubation criteria** | Awake, commands, adequate ventilation, SpO₂ acceptable, TOF ≥0.9 | Same | **More stringent:** fully awake, minimal somnolence, robust ventilation, TOF ≥0.9 | Standard | Lower threshold to delay extubation in high-risk phenotypes |

**Protocol 3 emergence safety (opioid-inclusive):**
- **Key risk:** increased PONV and dose-dependent respiratory depression risk (especially OSA/OHS, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve).
- Anticipate delayed emergence and hypoventilation risk; do not extubate with somnolence or inadequate ventilation.
- Naloxone should be available per institutional practice (e.g., 0.04–0.08 mg IV titrated) when clinically indicated.

## Postoperative Pain Management

### Expected Early Pain (0–6 hours PACU)

| Protocol | Expected NRS (0–10) | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks)** | 0–3 | Typically excellent early analgesia from ACB + IPACK; limited rescue needs |
| **Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free)** | 2–5 | More variable; depends on infiltration quality and systemic multimodal; rescue needs may be higher than Protocol 1 |
| **Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive)** | 2–6 | Variable; early scores may be deceptively low from residual opioid effect, with possible rebound pain later; higher rescue risk if no regional analgesia |

### Scheduled Multimodal (All Protocols)

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Contraindications/Cautions |
|------------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg PO/IV | q6h | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment) / 4 g/day (normal) | Reduce <50 kg; avoid severe hepatic failure |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg PO | q12h | 400 mg/day | Avoid per institutional policy: CrCl <30, GI bleed risk, recent CV event, aspirin allergy |
| **Ketorolac (alt)** | 15 mg IV | q6h | 60 mg/day; ≤5 days | Conservative use; avoid higher-risk phenotypes per clinician judgment |
| **Meloxicam (alt)** | 7.5–15 mg PO | daily | 15 mg/day | NSAID precautions apply |

**NSAID decision-making:**
- Substantial opioid-sparing benefit when safe.
- Use high caution in renal impairment, high bleeding risk, significant CV disease, and concurrent anticoagulation; follow institutional pathways.

### Rescue Analgesia (Conservative)

| Protocol | First-Line Rescue | Dosing | Second-Line | Monitoring Requirements |
|----------|------------------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Protocol 1** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (reassess each dose) | Consider ketamine rescue per institutional protocol | Standard PACU monitoring; continuous SpO₂ |
| **Protocol 2** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (reassess each dose) | Consider ketamine rescue per institutional protocol | Continuous SpO₂; anticipate higher rescue needs |
| **Protocol 3** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (titrate cautiously) | Reassess multimodal before escalation | **Mandatory continuous SpO₂**; consider capnography in high-risk |

**Elderly/frail/OSA rescue dosing:**
- Start hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV** with longer reassessment intervals (20–30 minutes).
- Lower threshold to prioritize non-opioid rescue modalities and monitoring escalation.

**Ketamine rescue analgesia (institution-dependent):**
- Typical sub-dissociative dose ~0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV.
- Apply ketamine contraindications and monitoring expectations.

## Clinical Outcomes Comparison (Directional Expectations)

| Outcome Measure | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pain control (0–24h)** | Excellent | Good–variable | Variable |
| **PONV risk** | Low | Low–moderate | Higher |
| **Sedation** | Minimal | Minimal–moderate | Moderate–higher; may be prolonged |
| **Time to mobilization** | Earlier | Early–moderate | Often delayed by PONV/sedation |
| **Delirium risk (elderly)** | Lower | Lower | Higher (multifactorial) |
| **Respiratory events** | Lower | Lower–moderate | Higher (dose/phenotype dependent) |
| **PACU LOS** | Shorter | Similar | Often longer |
| **Satisfaction** | High | Moderate–high | Variable |

---

## Safety Monitoring Requirements

### Intraoperative (All Protocols)
- Standard ASA monitors: ECG, SpO₂, capnography, BP at appropriate intervals, temperature.
- **Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (TOF):** mandatory when NMBD used.
- Consider processed EEG (BIS/entropy) in elderly/frail to avoid excessive depth.
- Consider arterial line for severe cardiac disease or anticipated hemodynamic lability.

### PACU/Postoperative

| Monitoring Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Continuous pulse oximetry** | Standard | Standard (often longer than P1) | **Mandatory continuous** until fully awake/stable |
| **Capnography** | Consider in OSA/high risk | Consider in OSA/high risk | Strongly consider in OSA/OHS, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, higher opioid exposure |
| **Sedation assessments** | Routine | Routine | More frequent with low threshold to escalate care |
| **Naloxone readiness** | Per routine | Per routine | Ready/available per institutional protocol |
| **LAST readiness** | Lipid emulsion available when blocks performed | N/A | Lipid emulsion available if blocks performed |

### Floor Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
- All protocols: vitals and pain assessments per institutional pathway.
- Protocol 3: consider enhanced respiratory monitoring in high-risk phenotypes; lower threshold for step-down/ICU if concerning features.

---

## Contraindications and Safety Considerations

### Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) – Avoid When:
**Absolute contraindications to blocks:**
- Patient refusal after informed consent
- Infection at site/systemic sepsis
- Anticoagulation outside ASRA + institutional windows
- Known anaphylaxis to amide local anesthetics

**Adjunct precautions:**
- Ketamine: active psychosis; avoid severe uncontrolled HTN per judgment
- Dexmedetomidine: high-grade AV block without pacemaker; symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension
- Magnesium: CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced AV block

### Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) – Avoid When:
- Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated and opioid-sparing cannot be safely implemented
- Institutional resources for OFIA monitoring/support are not available
- Shared decision-making favors opioid-inclusive pathway

### Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) – Avoid When Possible In:
- Severe/untreated OSA or OHS
- COPD with hypercapnia/home oxygen
- Prior postoperative respiratory failure
- Frail elderly, baseline cognitive impairment, prior POD
- Severe opioid-associated PONV history
- Patient preference for opioid-sparing approach

**If Protocol 3 is used in high-risk phenotypes:**
- Use lowest effective opioid doses, early taper, avoid stacking.
- Implement explicit enhanced monitoring plan.

## ASRA/ESRA Anticoagulation Timing (Reference Framework — Verify Current Guidance)

**Applies to:** Deep peripheral nerve blocks (ACB, IPACK) in Protocols 1 and 3

> **Critical:** This table is directional guidance only. Always consult:
> 1. Current ASRA/ESRA guidance
> 2. Institutional anticoagulation protocols (supersede)
> 3. Patient-specific factors: renal function, true dosing, interactions

### Preoperative Holds (Time Before Block)

| Anticoagulant | CrCl >50 | CrCl 30–50 | CrCl <30 | Notes |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|-------|
| **DOACs** (apixaban/rivaroxaban/edoxaban) | ≥72h | ≥96h | ≥120h | Verify last dose timing; drug levels if available per institution |
| **Dabigatran** | ≥72h | ≥96h | ≥120h | More renal dependence; longer holds in renal impairment |
| **Warfarin** | INR per institution (often ≤1.4) | Same | Same | Verify INR day-of per policy |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24h | ≥24h | Consult hematology | Higher bleeding risk |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥12h | ≥12h | Often ≥24h | Institutional variability |
| **UFH prophylaxis** | 4–6h | 4–6h | 4–6h | Verify aPTT if therapeutic |
| **Aspirin** | No hold | No hold | No hold | Peripheral block permissive guidance; institutional policies apply |
| **Clopidogrel** | 5–7d | 5–7d | 5–7d | Institutional variability; verify local policy |
| **NSAIDs** | No hold | No hold | No hold | Peripheral block permissive guidance; institutional policies apply |

### Postoperative Restart (After Block)

| Anticoagulant | Minimum Time | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|------|
| **DOACs / Dabigatran** | ≥6h (single-shot) | Often longer per institution and bleeding risk |
| **Warfarin** | Per surgical/medicine plan | Commonly evening of surgery/POD1 |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24h | High bleeding risk; verify with surgical team |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥6–12h | Institutional variability |
| **Aspirin/NSAIDs** | Continue | No hold typically required |
| **Clopidogrel** | Per institutional/cardiology plan | Verify |

**Documentation requirements:**
- Last anticoagulant dose time, renal function, institutional compliance verification, and risk/benefit discussion when non-standard.

---

## Key Clinical Pearls

### General Principles
1. **Propofol induction (1.5–2 mg/kg) is standard**; reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg with slow titration in elderly/frail/severe cardiac disease.
2. **Protocol 1 is first-line when feasible:** best early analgesia with opioid-sparing physiology.
3. **Protocol 2 preserves opioid-sparing benefit without blocks** but expect more variable analgesia and higher rescue needs than Protocol 1.
4. **Protocol 3 is a fallback pathway:** conservative opioid use, early taper, and monitoring escalation are mandatory.

### Dosing and Adjuncts
5. **Dexmedetomidine:** infusion-first; avoid bolus loading due to bradycardia/hypotension risk.
6. **Magnesium:** potentiates NMBD; quantitative TOF monitoring is essential.
7. **Ketamine:** alters processed EEG indices; do not titrate hypnosis to BIS alone when ketamine is used.

### Monitoring and Emergence
8. **TOF ratio ≥0.9 before extubation** is non-negotiable.
9. **Protocol 3 requires stricter extubation criteria** and lower threshold to delay extubation in OSA/elderly/frail or higher opioid exposure.
10. **LAST preparedness** is mandatory whenever regional blocks are performed.

## End of Document

**Remember:** This protocol represents a synthesis of current evidence and expert consensus to guide clinical decision-making. It is not a substitute for clinical judgment, individualized patient assessment, or institutional oversight. Safe anesthetic care requires qualified practitioners, appropriate resources, ongoing education, and commitment to continuous quality improvement.

**Patient safety is paramount.** When in doubt, consult senior colleagues, review primary literature, and prioritize conservative approaches that minimize risk while optimizing outcomes.

**Governance Statement:**  
This document is an educational perioperative anesthesia framework intended to support structured clinical reasoning and multidisciplinary discussion. It serves dual purposes: (1) clinical decision support for attending anesthesiologists, and (2) educational framework for residents, CRNAs, and students. It does not supersede institutional policy, order sets, anticoagulation guidance, pharmacy restrictions, credentialing/privileging requirements, or attending anesthesiologist judgment. When conflicts arise, institutional governance and patient-specific risk assessment prevail.

**Governance Lock:**  
This document intentionally avoids prescribing institution-specific order sets, mandated dosing, or hard monitoring thresholds. Any operational implementation requires anesthesia department approval, pharmacy review, nursing workflow validation, and explicit alignment with institutional opioid stewardship and postoperative monitoring policies.

Quick reference comparing three evidence-informed anesthetic pathways for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). All pathways prioritize conservative starting doses, physiologic titration, and phenotype-based monitoring intensification.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**
> - All doses represent conservative starting ranges and require titration to physiologic effect and monitoring data.
> - Attending anesthesiologist judgment and local protocols supersede this framework.
> - Special populations (elderly/frail, OSA/OHS, severe cardiac disease, renal/hepatic impairment, chronic opioid therapy) require dose reduction and monitoring escalation.

## Attending Validation Summary
### Intended Clinical Output When Applied Correctly

This comparison table is structured to match the attending anesthesiologist’s pragmatic decision model:

1. **Induction is reliable:** loss of consciousness is achieved predictably with a **propofol IV bolus** (with indicated co-boluses) to produce consistent airway conditions.  
2. **Maintenance is controllable:** unconsciousness is maintained by a continuous hypnotic strategy (propofol infusion and/or age-adjusted volatile anesthetic). Adjuncts modulate analgesia and sympathetic tone; they do not replace hypnosis.  
3. **Physiology is managed proactively:** hemodynamic targets, vasoactive rescue strategy, neuromuscular blockade monitoring, and depth management are explicit and anticipatory.  
4. **Emergence is protected:** infusions are tapered with intent, opioid stacking near extubation is avoided, **TOF ratio ≥ 0.9** is confirmed, and extubation criteria are risk-stratified.

---

## Universal Workflow Principles
### Applied Across All Three Pathways

These principles reflect common attending practice patterns and are written as defaults—not absolutes.

### Induction: Bolus-Dominant Strategy
- Induction is typically bolus-driven to achieve rapid, reliable loss of consciousness and airway conditions.
- A **propofol IV bolus** is the default hypnotic event in this framework.
- Adjunct boluses (e.g., fentanyl in opioid-inclusive pathways, ketamine when indicated) are used to attenuate sympathetic response and support analgesia, not to replace hypnosis.

### Maintenance: Continuous-Delivery Strategy
- Maintenance is typically infusion- or continuous-delivery–based to reduce depth oscillation and stabilize physiology.
- **Propofol infusion** is the default hypnotic spine when TIVA is selected.
- Volatile agent (e.g., sevoflurane) may be used as an alternative or adjunct depending on workflow and institutional practice.

### Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity
**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by one of the following (or a balanced combination):**
- **Propofol TIVA:** 75–150 mcg/kg/min (typical 75–125; higher end phenotype/workflow-dependent)  
**and/or**
- **Sevoflurane:** ~0.7–1.0 MAC (age-adjusted)

**OFIA adjuncts are additive, not substitutive:**
- Dexmedetomidine: sedation and sympatholysis (not surgical hypnosis)
- Ketamine (low-dose): analgesia and dissociation (not reliably sufficient for unconsciousness)
- Lidocaine and magnesium: analgesia/anti-hyperalgesia (not hypnosis)

**Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness.**

### Emergence: Planned Taper and Verification
- Emergence is treated as a safety-critical phase requiring explicit planning.
- Taper hypnotic/adjunct infusions approximately **10–15 minutes** prior to anticipated end of surgery (case- and phenotype-dependent).
- Avoid late-case opioid stacking when feasible.
- Confirm extubation criteria and **TOF ratio ≥ 0.9** prior to airway removal.

## Protocol Comparison At-a-Glance

### Key Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Positioning** | **FIRST-LINE** (preferred when feasible) | **SECOND-LINE** (when blocks contraindicated) | **THIRD-LINE** (reserved for specific indications only)* |
| **Regional Analgesia** | ACB + IPACK (80mg ropivacaine) | None (surgeon infiltration) | Optional (when feasible) |
| **Intraop Opioids** | Zero | Zero | Fentanyl infusion ± hydromorphone |
| **Expected PACU Pain (NRS)** | 0–3 (excellent) | 2–5 (good-variable) | 2–6 (variable) |
| **PONV Risk** | Low | Low-Moderate | Moderate-High |
| **Respiratory Depression Risk** | Lowest | Low | Higher (phenotype-dependent) |
| **Mobilization Timing** | 4–6 hours | 4–8 hours | Often delayed (PONV/sedation) |
| **OSA Suitability** | **Strongly Preferred** | **Strongly Preferred** | Avoid if possible; enhanced monitoring required |
| **Elderly/Frail Suitability** | **Strongly Preferred** | **Strongly Preferred** | Higher delirium/respiratory event risk |
| **Chronic Opioid Users** | Appropriate | Appropriate | Often preferred option |
| **Workflow Complexity** | Moderate (blocks add time) | Low (fastest) | Low-Moderate |

**Important Note on Protocol 3:**
*Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) is **deliberately constrained as third-line** and should only be used when:
- Chronic opioid therapy with high tolerance (>60-90 MME/day)
- Multiple OFIA adjunct contraindications
- Prior OFIA intolerance or complications
- Explicit patient preference after informed consent
- Attending judgment that opioid-based approach is safer for specific patient

**Default approach:** When blocks are not feasible, prefer Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) over Protocol 3 unless specific indications exist.

### Expected Outcomes Comparison

| Outcome | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **0-6hr Pain Control** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐ Variable |
| **0-24hr Pain Control** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐ Variable |
| **PONV Rate** |  Lowest | Low | Higher |
| **Sedation** | Minimal | Minimal | Moderate |
| **Respiratory Safety** | Safest | Safe | Requires vigilance |
| **Early Mobilization** | Earliest | Early | Often delayed |
| **PACU Length of Stay** | Shortest | Short | Often longer |
| **Patient Satisfaction** | High | High | Variable |

### Workflow Complexity Explained

**What "Workflow Complexity" Means:**

| Complexity Level | Time Impact | Resource Requirements | Team Coordination |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Low** (Protocol 2) | Fastest workflow (no block time) | Standard OR setup | Minimal coordination |
| **Moderate** (Protocol 1) | +15-30 min for blocks | Block area/equipment; ultrasound; lipid emulsion | Requires block practitioner; LAST preparedness |
| **Low-Moderate** (Protocol 3) | Similar to Protocol 2 | Standard OR setup + enhanced PACU monitoring | Increased PACU/floor coordination; monitoring escalation planning |

**Time Estimates:**
- Protocol 1: Total anesthetic time includes 15-30 minutes for ACB/IPACK placement
- Protocol 2: No additional time beyond standard anesthetic (fastest)
- Protocol 3: Similar intraop time, but often longer PACU stays (120-180 min vs 60-90 min)

**Resource Implications:**
- Protocol 1: Ultrasound, block equipment, trained practitioner, lipid emulsion
- Protocol 2: Standard equipment only
- Protocol 3: Enhanced monitoring equipment (capnography more commonly needed), naloxone at bedside, potential for monitored bed

### Protocol 1 vs Protocol 2: Direct Contrast

**When blocks are feasible, Protocol 1 provides:**

| Advantage of Protocol 1 over Protocol 2 | Magnitude |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Better early pain control** | NRS 0-3 vs 2-5 (2-point improvement) |
| **Lower PONV risk** | ~10-15% vs ~20-25% incidence |
| **Earlier mobilization** | 4-6 hrs vs 4-8 hrs (median 1-2 hr earlier) |
| **Less PACU opioid rescue** | ~70% reduction in rescue needs |
| **Longer analgesic duration** | 12-18 hrs from blocks vs 6-12 hrs from infiltration |
| **Higher patient satisfaction** | Consistently rated higher in quality studies |

**When blocks are NOT feasible:**
- Protocol 2 maintains all opioid-sparing benefits of OFIA approach
- Still significantly superior to Protocol 3 for OSA/elderly/frail patients
- Requires robust multimodal foundation and anticipated rescue planning

*High PONV risk (Apfel ≥3): Strongly favor Protocol 1 or 2 over 3
**Attending judgment required: Verify specific indication for Protocol 3
```

**Clinical Decision Points Requiring Attending Judgment:**

1. **High PONV Risk (Apfel ≥3):**
   - **Strongly prefer** Protocol 1 (best) or Protocol 2 over Protocol 3
   - If Protocol 3 used: Implement aggressive multimodal PONV prophylaxis

2. **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3):**
   - **Strongly prefer** Protocol 1 or Protocol 2
   - If Protocol 3 used: Mandatory enhanced monitoring + lower opioid doses

3. **Elderly/Frail:**
   - **Strongly prefer** Protocol 1 or Protocol 2 with dose reductions
   - If Protocol 3 used: Conservative dosing + extended monitoring

4. **Chronic Opioid Use (>60-90 MME/day):**
   - Protocol 3 may be appropriate
   - Consider opioid responsiveness, not just raw MME
   - Document clear rationale for protocol selection

5. **Multiple Contraindications:**
   - If 2+ OFIA adjuncts contraindicated: Protocol 3 may be safest option
   - Explicit risk-benefit discussion and documentation required

**Decision Documentation Required:**
- [ ] Reason for protocol selection documented in anesthetic record
- [ ] If Protocol 3 selected: specific indications noted (chronic opioids >X MME/day, contraindications to OFIA adjuncts, etc.)
- [ ] If blocks omitted: reason documented (anticoagulation, refusal, anatomy, time constraints, etc.)
- [ ] High-risk phenotypes flagged: OSA, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, PONV risk


## Protocol Selection Guide
### Which Analgesic Strategy Fits the Patient?

| Patient Factor | Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid-Inclusive) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **First-line choice** | **Preferred** when blocks feasible and safe | Preferred when blocks contraindicated/refused | Reserved when OFIA is inappropriate/contraindicated or per shared decision-making |
| **Anticoagulation timing** | Must meet **ASRA + institutional** requirements for deep peripheral blocks | Any timing (no blocks) | Any timing if no blocks; ASRA/institutional timing if blocks used |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Strongly preferred** (opioid-sparing + regional) | **Strongly preferred** over opioid pathway | Avoid if possible; if used: conservative dosing + enhanced monitoring |
| **Elderly/frail** | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | **Strongly preferred** with dose reduction | Avoid if possible; higher delirium/respiratory event risk |
| **Chronic opioid therapy** | Appropriate; continue baseline regimen | Appropriate; continue baseline regimen | Appropriate; anticipate tolerance and higher postoperative requirements |
| **Patient refuses blocks** | Not applicable | **Preferred** | Alternative |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic strategy | Appropriate with careful hemodynamic strategy | May be preferred if dexmedetomidine is contraindicated |
| **High-grade AV block / baseline bradycardia** | Dexmedetomidine often contraindicated | Dexmedetomidine often contraindicated | May be preferred option |

## Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Aligned)

| Medication | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 1 g PO | 60–90 min pre-op | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 200–400 mg PO | 1–2 hrs pre-op | Avoid/contraindicate per institutional policy: CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | 8 mg IV | After IV access | Consider 4–6 mg if diabetic; monitor glucose per protocol |
| **Scopolamine patch** | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | 1.5 mg TD | Evening prior or ≥4 hrs pre-op | High PONV-risk phenotype; avoid in narrow-angle glaucoma; anticholinergic delirium risk in frail elderly |
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | 0.5–1 mg IV | Holding area | **Reduce to 0.5 mg or omit** in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | N/A | Sedation/delirium risk often outweighs incremental benefit in modern multimodal pathways |
| **Home opioids** | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Continue baseline | Morning of surgery | Do not escalate pre-op; coordinate with chronic pain plan if present |

---

## Regional Analgesia (Protocols 1 and optional in 3)

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Adductor Canal Block (ACB)** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **IPACK** | **Yes** – 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (40 mg) | No | Optional (beneficial when feasible) |
| **Total ropivacaine dose** | **80 mg** (typically well below 3 mg/kg in most adults) | N/A | 80 mg if blocks performed |
| **ASRA/institution anticoagulation compliance** | **Mandatory** | N/A | **Mandatory if blocks performed** |
| **LAST preparedness** | **20% lipid emulsion immediately available**; protocol visible | N/A | Same if blocks performed |
| **Expected analgesic duration** | ~12–18 hours (variable) | N/A | ~12–18 hours if blocks performed |
| **Motor preservation intent** | Quadriceps-sparing approach | N/A | Same if blocks performed |

**Conservative ropivacaine dosing rationale:**
- 0.2% concentration supports analgesia with lower toxicity risk than higher concentrations.
- Total dose should be interpreted in context of *all* local anesthetic sources (blocks + surgeon infiltration).
- Institutional maximum dose policies and patient-specific risk factors (age, frailty, hepatic disease, low body mass) supersede typical thresholds.

### Regional Anesthesia Safety Considerations (Protocol 1)

**Proactive Risk Management:**

| Complication | Prevention Strategy | Early Recognition | Management |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **LAST** | • Conservative ropivacaine concentration (0.2%)<br>• Incremental injection with aspiration<br>• Document total LA burden<br>• 20% lipid emulsion immediately available | • Perioral numbness, tinnitus<br>• Metallic taste, dizziness<br>• Agitation, confusion | • Stop LA injection<br>• Call for help<br>• Lipid emulsion protocol<br>• ACLS with modifications |
| **Block Failure** | • Ultrasound confirmation of spread<br>• Test sensation before leaving block area<br>• Document quality assessment | • Pain >NRS 4 in first 6 hours<br>• Sensory testing shows inadequate distribution | • Optimize multimodal foundation<br>• Ketamine rescue if institutional protocol<br>• Opioid rescue with enhanced monitoring<br>• Consider regional consultation |
| **Infection** | • Strict aseptic technique<br>• Chlorhexidine skin prep<br>• Sterile probe cover | • Injection site erythema/warmth<br>• Systemic fever<br>• Increasing pain at site | • Discontinue if catheter in place<br>• Surgical evaluation<br>• Cultures if indicated<br>• Antibiotics per protocol |
| **Nerve Injury** | • Avoid paresthesias during injection<br>• Stop if high injection pressure<br>• Document motor function pre/post | • Persistent numbness beyond block duration<br>• Motor weakness unexpected from block<br>• Burning/electric pain | • Neurology consultation<br>• Serial motor/sensory exams<br>• Document distribution<br>• Consider EMG/NCS if persistent |
| **Hematoma** | • Verify anticoagulation timing<br>• Avoid vascular puncture<br>• Direct pressure post-procedure | • Swelling at injection site<br>• Tense compartment<br>• Distal neurovascular changes | • Surgical evaluation<br>• Monitor compartment pressures<br>• Escalate care rapidly |

**Documentation Requirements for Block Complications:**
- [ ] Time of block placement
- [ ] Total ropivacaine dose (mg)
- [ ] Quality assessment (excellent/good/fair/poor)
- [ ] Motor function verification
- [ ] Any unusual resistance, paresthesias, or patient discomfort during placement
- [ ] PACU sensory/motor assessment
- [ ] Any complications or concerns

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Any suspected LAST → Immediate lipid emulsion protocol
- Block failure with NRS ≥6 → Attending anesthesiologist consultation
- Suspected nerve injury → Neurology consultation
- Suspected compartment syndrome → **Emergency surgical consultation**

---

## Induction (Conservative Adult Dosing)

> **Lidocaine note (injection pain):** 20–40 mg IV (~0.5 mg/kg) immediately before propofol may reduce injection pain. This is distinct from systemic lidocaine infusion protocols.

| Agent | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) | Special Population Adjustments |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Midazolam** | 0–1 mg IV (often omit if already given) | 0–1 mg IV | 0–1 mg IV | **Age >75/frail/OSA:** 0.5 mg max or omit |
| **Lidocaine (injection pain)** | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | 20–40 mg IV | Optional; omit if not needed |
| **Propofol** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | **Age >75/frail/severe cardiac disease:** 1–1.5 mg/kg; slow titration |
| **Ketamine (adjunct)** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV (optional) | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV (optional) | **Elderly/frail:** 0.1–0.2 mg/kg or omit |
| **Fentanyl** | None (OFIA principle) | None (OFIA principle) | **25–100 mcg IV** (titrate) | **Age >75/OSA/opioid-naïve:** start 25–50 mcg |
| **Rocuronium** | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | Dose to IBW/AdjBW in obesity; **TOF monitoring mandatory** |
| **Dexmedetomidine bolus** | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended | Bolus increases bradycardia/hypotension risk |
| **Magnesium loading** | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | 30–40 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min (optional) | Not routine | Avoid in CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced heart block; potentiates NMBD |

**Critical safety notes:**
- Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension; ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue per institutional practice.
- Ketamine is relatively contraindicated in active psychosis; avoid in severe uncontrolled hypertension per clinician judgment.
- Magnesium potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate longer paralysis and ensure quantitative TOF monitoring.

## Maintenance Anesthesia
**All protocols require continuous propofol and/or volatile anesthesia (see “Hypnotic Continuity”).**

### Hypnotic Maintenance (All Protocols)

| Option | Dosing (typical) | Advantages | Limitations | Preferred When |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Propofol TIVA** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to effect/monitoring) | Antiemetic; precise titration; MH-safe | Requires reliable IV access; prolonged high-dose infusions are not routine | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; depth control prioritized |
| **Sevoflurane** | **~0.7–1.0 MAC** (age-adjusted) | Familiar workflow; rapid titration | Higher PONV risk vs propofol | Standard workflow; IV access limitations; institutional preference |
| **Balanced technique** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + sevo 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce dose of each agent | More complex titration | Select scenarios per clinician/institution preference |

**Age-adjusted MAC (directional guidance):**
- 65–75: reduce ~20%
- 75–85: reduce ~30–40%
- 85: reduce ~40–50%

### OFIA Adjuncts (Protocols 1 & 2)

| Agent | Protocol 1 Dosing | Protocol 2 Dosing | Key Contraindications/Precautions | Monitoring Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Dexmedetomidine (infusion only)** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | High-grade AV block (no pacer), symptomatic bradycardia, hypotension | Continuous HR/BP; reduce/stop for bradycardia/hypotension |
| **Ketamine infusion (optional)** | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr | Active psychosis; avoid in severe uncontrolled HTN per judgment | Ketamine may elevate BIS; avoid titrating hypnosis to BIS alone |
| **Lidocaine infusion (optional; institutional protocol)** | Not routine | 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr | Severe hepatic dysfunction, significant conduction disease, amide allergy | Monitor for CNS toxicity; follow institutional policy |
| **Magnesium (if loaded)** | Continue per local protocol | Continue per local protocol | CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced AV block | Potentiates NMBD; ensure quantitative TOF |

**Dexmedetomidine practice notes:**
- Elderly/frail: typically 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr.
- Taper/stop ~10–15 minutes prior to end of case to reduce prolonged sedation.
- Bradycardia strategy: reduce/stop infusion first; treat symptoms per clinician judgment and institutional practice.

**Ketamine practice notes:**
- Elderly/frail: often 0.1 mg/kg/hr max or omit.
- BIS caveat: ketamine can increase processed EEG indices; interpret in clinical context.

### Opioid Strategy (Protocol 3 Only)

**Core principle:** opioid-inclusive does not mean opioid-heavy. Prefer conservative dosing, early taper, and avoid late stacking.

**Intraoperative options (choose one approach; avoid mixing high-dose boluses + continuous infusion late in case):**
- **Bolus-first (preferred for most):** fentanyl 25–50 mcg increments titrated to stimulus and physiology  
- **Low-rate infusion (select cases):** fentanyl ~0.5–1.0 mcg/kg/hr with **planned taper/stop 20–30 minutes before emergence** (earlier in OSA/elderly/frail/opioid-naïve)

**End-of-case planning (avoid near-extubation stacking):**
- Hydromorphone **0.2–0.6 mg IV total** in small increments with reassessment  
  - OSA/elderly/frail: start **0.2 mg** and reassess longer

**Operational safety controls (Protocol 3):**
- Avoid late-case opioid stacking (primary emergence safety control).
- Ensure an explicit PACU respiratory monitoring plan for high-risk phenotypes (consider capnography where available).

## Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) - Enhanced Safety Framework

> **CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY: Opioid-Minimization Remains Primary Goal**
> 
> Even in Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive), the overarching principle is **minimizing opioid exposure** while maintaining adequate analgesia. This protocol exists for specific clinical situations where opioid-free approaches are inappropriate or contraindicated—it is **NOT** a return to legacy opioid-heavy anesthesia.
>
> **Core Tenets:**
> - Use **lowest effective opioid doses**
> - Implement **early planned taper** (not reactive)
> - **Avoid late-case stacking** (primary safety control)
> - Maintain **multimodal analgesia foundation**
> - Deploy **enhanced monitoring** for high-risk phenotypes
> - Default to **Protocol 1 or 2 whenever clinically appropriate**
>
> **Protocol 3 is a deliberate exception, not a convenience option.**

> **Key Principle:** Protocol 3 should be used as a **deliberate, constrained, third-line pathway** with explicit safety controls, not a default or "easier" option.

### When Protocol 3 is Appropriate

**Consider Protocol 3 when:**
1. **Chronic opioid therapy** with high tolerance (typically >60-90 MME/day; see responsiveness discussion in Protocol 3 document)
2. **Multiple OFIA adjunct contraindications:**
   - Active psychosis (ketamine contraindicated)
   - High-grade AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine contraindicated)
   - Severe hepatic impairment (lidocaine infusion contraindicated)
   - CrCl <30 mL/min (magnesium contraindicated)
3. **Prior OFIA intolerance** or complications
4. **Patient preference** for opioid-inclusive approach after informed consent and shared decision-making
5. **Attending judgment** that opioid-based approach safer for specific patient

### When to AVOID Protocol 3 (Prefer Protocol 1 or 2)

**Strong contraindications:**
- Severe/untreated OSA or obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- COPD with baseline hypercapnia or home oxygen requirement
- Prior postoperative respiratory failure or naloxone requirement
- Frail elderly with baseline cognitive impairment or prior delirium
- Severe opioid-associated PONV history
- **Patient preference for opioid-sparing** after counseling

**If Protocol 3 MUST be used in high-risk phenotypes:**
- Use **lowest effective opioid doses**
- **Early taper** (stop fentanyl 30 min before emergence, not 20 min)
- **Avoid stacking** near extubation (no late-case hydromorphone)
- Implement **explicit enhanced monitoring plan** (document in record)
- **Lower threshold** for monitored bed vs floor placement

### Opioid Delivery Strategy (Conservative Framework)

**Intraoperative Approach - Choose ONE:**

| Strategy | Details | Best For | Avoid When |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Low-Rate Infusion** (Preferred) | Fentanyl 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg/hr<br>**Stop 20-30 min before emergence** | Most patients; more predictable emergence | Very short cases (<60 min) |
| **Bolus-Responsive** | Fentanyl 25-50 mcg increments titrated to stimulus | Variable-length cases; attending preference | Tends toward late stacking if not disciplined |

**End-of-Case Planning:**
- **Hydromorphone:** 0.2-0.6mg IV total in small increments
- **DO NOT give hydromorphone <15-20 minutes before planned extubation**
- **OSA/elderly/frail/opioid-naïve:** Start 0.2mg with ≥20min reassessment intervals

**Critical Safety Controls:**
1. **Planned early taper** (not reactive to emergence)
2. **Avoid late-case stacking** (primary emergence safety control)
3. **Document total opioid exposure** (fentanyl mcg + hydromorphone mg)
4. **Communicate to PACU** enhanced monitoring needs

### PACU Rescue Analgesia (Protocol 3 Specific)

**Pain management is MORE COMPLEX in Protocol 3:**
- Early pain scores may be **deceptively low** from residual opioid effect
- **Rebound pain** common as intraop opioids wear off
- **Higher total rescue needs** than Protocols 1 or 2

**Rescue Strategy:**

| Pain Level | First-Line | Dosing | Second-Line |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **NRS 4-6** | Ensure multimodal optimized | Verify acetaminophen + NSAID given | Consider ketamine 10-20mg IV if institutional protocol |
| **NRS ≥7** | Hydromorphone | 0.2-0.4mg IV q15-20min | Reassess multimodal; consider regional consultation if refractory |

**Phenotype-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Opioid-naïve:** 0.2mg hydromorphone q20-30min; **mandatory continuous pulse oximetry**
- **Elderly/frail:** 0.2mg q25-30min; enhanced sedation monitoring (RASS q10min)
- **OSA:** 0.2mg q30min; **strongly consider capnography**; continuous monitoring
- **Chronic opioid users:** 0.4-0.8mg q15-20min; anticipate tolerance; may need pain service early

**Rescue Options NOT Recommended:**
- **Gabapentinoids** (sedation/delirium risk; not routinely recommended)
- **Additional local anesthetic infusions** (not appropriate for rescue; LAST risk)
- **Aggressive opioid escalation** without attending consultation

**Enhanced Monitoring Triggers:**
- Cumulative hydromorphone >1mg → continuous pulse oximetry + capnography consideration
- Any sedation (RASS ≤-1) → reduce/hold opioids, escalate monitoring
- Respiratory rate <10 → **immediate intervention** (see respiratory depression algorithm)

### Naloxone Protocol

**Preparation:**
- Naloxone **at bedside** in PACU for all Protocol 3 patients
- Typical concentration: 0.4mg/mL
- Dilute to 0.04mg/mL (0.4mg in 10mL NS) for easier titration

**Indications for Naloxone:**
- SpO₂ <90% despite airway maneuvers and O₂
- Respiratory rate <8 breaths/min
- Apneic episodes
- Somnolence (RASS ≤-3) with inadequate ventilation

**Dosing:**
1. Start with **0.04-0.08mg IV** (1-2mL of diluted solution)
2. Reassess in **2-3 minutes**
3. Repeat as needed until:
   - RR ≥10 breaths/min
   - SpO₂ >92%
   - Adequate tidal volumes (visual chest rise)
4. **Goal:** Restore adequate ventilation, NOT full reversal

**Post-Naloxone Management:**
- Anticipate **pain rebound** (provide multimodal analgesia: acetaminophen 1g IV + ketorolac 15mg IV if not contraindicated)
- Naloxone duration 30-90 min; opioid effects **may outlast naloxone by 2-4 hours**
- **Mandatory enhanced monitoring protocol:**
  - **Continuous pulse oximetry** for minimum 4 hours (longer if repeat naloxone needed)
  - **Vital signs q15min** for first hour, then q30min for 3 hours
  - **RASS assessment q15min** for first hour, then q30min
  - **Respiratory rate monitoring:** Alert if <10 breaths/min
  - Consider **capnography** for entire monitoring period
- **Mandatory escalation to monitored bed** (step-down unit or PCU)
- **Attending anesthesiologist notification** required
- **Incident reporting** per institutional protocol
- Pain service consultation for multimodal optimization
- **Do NOT discharge to unmonitored floor** for minimum 4 hours post-naloxone

**Extended Monitoring Rationale:**
Opioid effects can outlast naloxone, especially with:
- Long-acting opioids (hydromorphone)
- High cumulative doses
- Elderly/frail patients with slower metabolism
- Renal impairment (delayed opioid clearance)

**Repeat Naloxone May Be Needed If:**
- Respiratory depression recurs >30 min after initial dose
- Sedation returns (RASS ≤-2)
- SpO₂ drops below 90% on room air

**Pain Management After Naloxone:**
- Multimodal foundation (acetaminophen + NSAID)
- Ketamine 10-20mg IV if institutional protocol permits
- If opioids needed: Use smallest effective doses with ≥30min intervals
- Enhanced monitoring continues for any subsequent opioid administration

### Protocol 3 Documentation Requirements

**Preoperative:**
- [ ] Indication for Protocol 3 selection documented
- [ ] Chronic opioid regimen recorded (if applicable): drug, dose, frequency, estimated MME/day
- [ ] Risk factors identified: OSA, age >75, frailty, opioid-naïve, prior respiratory events
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring plan discussed with patient and team

**Intraoperative:**
- [ ] Total opioid exposure documented: fentanyl total mcg, hydromorphone total mg
- [ ] Timing of opioid taper documented
- [ ] Any late-case opioids documented with rationale

**Postoperative:**
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring plan communicated to PACU/floor team
- [ ] High-risk features flagged (OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve, high exposure)
- [ ] Monitoring location determined (PACU → floor vs monitored bed)
- [ ] If naloxone given: incident report completed

### Protocol 3 Quality Metrics

**Institutions using Protocol 3 should track:**
- Percentage of rTKA cases using Protocol 3 (target: <20% of total cases)
- Naloxone administration rate (target: <2%)
- Unplanned monitored bed admissions (track and review)
- Respiratory events (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, apnea)
- PONV requiring rescue (target: <30%)
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Time to mobilization compared to Protocols 1 & 2

**Quarterly review recommended** to ensure Protocol 3 remains appropriately constrained and high-risk patients are adequately supported.

### Protocol 3: Final Reminders for Opioid Stewardship

**Before selecting Protocol 3, ask:**
1. Have I confirmed blocks are truly not feasible? (anticoagulation, refusal, anatomy)
2. Have I confirmed OFIA adjuncts are truly contraindicated or inappropriate?
3. Is this patient truly better served by opioids than enhanced OFIA multimodal approach?
4. Have I documented specific clinical rationale for Protocol 3 selection?
5. Have I implemented all available opioid-sparing strategies within Protocol 3?

**Remember:**
- OSA/elderly/frail patients are almost always better served by Protocol 1 or 2
- High PONV risk patients should avoid Protocol 3 when possible
- Opioid-naïve patients have heightened respiratory depression risk with Protocol 3
- **When in doubt, lean toward Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) over Protocol 3**

**The goal is always: minimum opioid exposure compatible with adequate analgesia and patient safety.**

## Hemodynamic Management (All Protocols)

| Parameter | Target | First-Line Management | Special Considerations |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **MAP** | ≥65 mmHg (individualize to baseline/comorbidity) | Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV (if HR adequate) / Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV (if HR low) | Chronic HTN, CAD, cerebrovascular disease: consider closer-to-baseline perfusion targets |
| **HR** | ~50–100 bpm (phenotype-dependent) | Bradycardia: evaluate etiology; treat per clinician judgment (e.g., anticholinergic if symptomatic) | If dexmedetomidine-related: reduce/stop infusion first |
| **Hypotension prevention** | N/A | Consider low-dose vasopressor infusion in predicted lability per institutional practice | Avoid indiscriminate fluid loading; use goal-directed strategy when available |

---

## Emergence

| Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 | Timing | Safety Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Taper adjuncts** | Reduce/stop dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine if used | Reduce/stop dexmedetomidine; taper ketamine/lidocaine if used | Stop opioid delivery; avoid late boluses | ~10–15 min before end | Prevent prolonged sedation/respiratory depression |
| **Hypnotic reduction** | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Taper propofol or reduce volatile | Skin closure → dressing | Titrate to ventilation and wakefulness |
| **Antiemetic** | Ondansetron 4 mg IV (typical) | Same | Same | Prior to emergence | Particularly important in opioid exposure |
| **NMBD reversal** | Sugammadex 2 mg/kg (TOF count ≥2) or 4 mg/kg (deep block) | Same | Same | Based on quantitative TOF | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 required** |
| **Extubation criteria** | Awake, commands, adequate ventilation, SpO₂ acceptable, TOF ≥0.9 | Same | **More stringent:** fully awake, minimal somnolence, robust ventilation, TOF ≥0.9 | Standard | Lower threshold to delay extubation in high-risk phenotypes |

**Protocol 3 emergence safety (opioid-inclusive):**
- **Key risk:** increased PONV and dose-dependent respiratory depression risk (especially OSA/OHS, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve).
- Anticipate delayed emergence and hypoventilation risk; do not extubate with somnolence or inadequate ventilation.
- Naloxone should be available per institutional practice (e.g., 0.04–0.08 mg IV titrated) when clinically indicated.

## Emergence and Early Recovery Complications

### Recognition and Management of Common Emergence Issues

#### Oversedation / Delayed Emergence

**Recognition:**
- RASS score ≤-2 (moderate to deep sedation)
- Difficult to arouse or unarousable
- Inadequate response to verbal/physical stimulation
- Time to emergence >15-20 minutes beyond expected

**Differential Diagnosis:**
| Cause | Assessment | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Excessive hypnotic** | Review total propofol/volatile dose | Allow time; stimulation; ensure adequate ventilation |
| **Residual opioids** (P3) | Recent doses; known opioid sensitivity | Reduce further opioids; consider naloxone if respiratory compromise |
| **Residual NMB** | **Check TOF ratio** | If TOF <0.9: additional sugammadex per protocol |
| **Adjunct stacking** | Dexmedetomidine continued too late | Allow time; support ventilation; rarely requires intervention |
| **Metabolic causes** | Check glucose, Na+, temp | Treat underlying cause |
| **Cerebrovascular event** | Focal deficits; unequal pupils | **STAT neurology consult**; head CT |

**Management Algorithm:**
1. **Ensure airway/ventilation/oxygenation adequate**
2. **Verify TOF ratio ≥0.9** (if not, reversal issue)
3. **Check glucose** (hypoglycemia common cause)
4. **Stop all sedatives/analgesics**
5. **Stimulate patient** (verbal, tactile, sternal rub if needed)
6. **Consider naloxone** if opioid-related AND respiratory compromise (0.04-0.08mg IV)
   - **Caution:** Avoid full reversal; titrate to effect
   - Risk: Acute pain, sympathetic surge, withdrawal (chronic opioid users)
7. **If no improvement in 5-10 minutes:** Reassess for other causes

**Do NOT extubate if:**
- Patient not following commands
- Inadequate ventilation (RR <10, TV <5mL/kg, weak respiratory effort)
- TOF <0.9
- Hemodynamic instability

#### Respiratory Depression

**Recognition:**
- Respiratory rate <10 breaths/min
- SpO₂ <90% despite supplemental O₂
- Shallow breathing (TV <5 mL/kg)
- Rising ETCO₂ (if still intubated/capnography available)
- Apneic episodes

**Risk Factors by Protocol:**
- Protocol 1 & 2: Rare (opioid-free intraop)
- Protocol 3: Common concern, especially with:
  - OSA/OHS
  - Elderly/frail
  - Opioid-naïve
  - Late-case opioid stacking
  - Concurrent sedatives

**Management:**
1. **Ensure patent airway** (jaw thrust, OPA/NPA if needed)
2. **Increase O₂** (high-flow via mask or bag-valve-mask)
3. **Stimulate patient** (sternal rub, verbal commands)
4. **STOP all opioids and sedatives**
5. **Naloxone 0.04-0.08 mg IV** if:
   - SpO₂ <90% despite airway maneuvers and O₂
   - RR <8 breaths/min
   - Apneic episodes
   - **Titrate slowly** to avoid withdrawal/pain/HTN/tachycardia
6. **Repeat naloxone** q2-3min as needed until:
   - RR ≥10 breaths/min
   - SpO₂ >92%
   - Adequate tidal volumes
7. **Consider re-intubation** if severe or refractory

**Post-Naloxone Care:**
- Naloxone duration 30-90 min; opioid effects may outlast naloxone
- **Continuous monitoring mandatory** for at least 2-4 hours
- **Escalate to monitored bed**
- Anticipate pain rebound (provide multimodal analgesia)

#### Severe PONV

**Highest Risk:**
- Protocol 3 (opioid exposure)
- Female, non-smoker, h/o PONV/motion sickness
- High Apfel score (≥3)

**Management:**
| Intervention | Details | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| **Ondansetron** | 4mg IV (repeat once if needed) | First-line 5-HT₃ antagonist |
| **Dexamethasone** | 4-8mg IV (if not given preop) | Best preop; limited benefit postop |
| **Scopolamine patch** | If not already placed | Takes 4+ hours to work |
| **Metoclopramide** | 10mg IV | Prokinetic + antiemetic |
| **Promethazine** | 6.25-12.5mg IV | Sedating; use cautiously |
| **Haloperidol** | 0.5-1mg IV | Where institutionally permitted |
| **Propofol** | 10-20mg IV bolus | Rescue for refractory PONV |

**Multimodal approach recommended for Apfel ≥3:**
- Preop: dexamethasone 8mg + scopolamine patch
- Intraop: propofol TIVA if feasible
- Emergence: ondansetron 4mg
- PACU: additional agents as needed

**Refractory PONV:**
- Consider propofol 10-20mg IV boluses
- Ensure hydration adequate
- Rule out other causes (hypotension, pain, anxiety)
- Consult attending for additional strategies

#### Emergence Delirium / Agitation

**Recognition:**
- Restlessness, thrashing, pulling at tubes/lines
- Disorientation, confusion
- Combativeness
- Failure to follow commands despite appearing awake

**Management Algorithm:**
1. **Rule out physiologic causes FIRST:**
   - [ ] Hypoxemia (check SpO₂)
   - [ ] Hypercarbia (check ventilation)
   - [ ] Hypotension (check MAP)
   - [ ] Hypoglycemia (check glucose)
   - [ ] **Pain** (assess and treat FIRST)
   - [ ] Urinary retention (bladder scan if Foley not placed)

2. **Environmental de-escalation:**
   - Calm, reassuring voice
   - Reorient patient ("Surgery is over, you're safe")
   - Minimize stimulation (lights, noise)
   - Family presence if permitted

3. **Pharmacologic management** (if behavioral measures inadequate):

**Standard Adult (no major frailty/elderly/OSA):**
- **Propofol 10-20mg IV** (short-acting, minimal respiratory depression) **OR**
- **Dexmedetomidine bolus 0.5 mcg/kg** over 10min + low-rate infusion (if already familiar from intraop)

**Elderly/Frail/OSA/Cognitive Impairment:**
- **AVOID benzodiazepines** (worsens delirium, respiratory depression, prolonged sedation)
- **First-line:** Haloperidol 0.5-1mg IV (where institutionally permitted)
- **Alternative:** Propofol 10mg IV (reassess q3-5min)
- **Last resort:** If severe and refractory, consult attending

**CRITICAL:** Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, midazolam) should be avoided or minimized in elderly, frail, and OSA patients due to significant risk of worsening delirium, respiratory depression, and prolonged recovery.

#### Prolonged Emergence / Delayed Recovery (Protocol 3 Specific)

**Definition:** Emergence >20-30 minutes beyond expected, or persistent somnolence despite adequate stimulation.

**Common in Protocol 3 due to:**
- Cumulative opioid effect (fentanyl + hydromorphone)
- Synergistic sedation (opioids + residual adjuncts)
- High-risk phenotypes (elderly/frail, OSA, opioid-naïve)
- Late-case opioid administration

**Prevention Strategies:**
- **Early opioid taper** (stop fentanyl 30 min before emergence in high-risk)
- **Avoid late-case stacking** (no hydromorphone <15-20 min before extubation)
- **Minimize adjunct overlap** near emergence
- **Plan extubation criteria** proactively based on phenotype

**Management if Prolonged Emergence Occurs:**
1. **Rule out residual NMB first** (verify TOF ≥0.9)
2. **Support ventilation** (maintain intubation if inadequate)
3. **Allow additional time** (opioids may take longer to redistribute)
4. **Consider small-dose naloxone** (0.04 mg IV) if respiratory compromise
5. **Monitor closely** for delayed respiratory depression after extubation
6. **Extended PACU observation** mandatory (minimum 2-4 hours)

**Communication to PACU:**
- Clearly state: "Prolonged emergence from opioid-inclusive protocol"
- Document total opioid exposure
- Flag high-risk features requiring enhanced monitoring
- Lower threshold for monitored bed placement

## Postoperative Pain Management

### Expected Early Pain (0–6 hours PACU)

| Protocol | Expected NRS (0–10) | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks)** | 0–3 | Typically excellent early analgesia from ACB + IPACK; limited rescue needs |
| **Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free)** | 2–5 | More variable; depends on infiltration quality and systemic multimodal; rescue needs may be higher than Protocol 1 |
| **Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive)** | 2–6 | Variable; early scores may be deceptively low from residual opioid effect, with possible rebound pain later; higher rescue risk if no regional analgesia |

### Scheduled Multimodal (All Protocols)

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Contraindications/Cautions |
|------------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg PO/IV | q6h | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment) / 4 g/day (normal) | Reduce <50 kg; avoid severe hepatic failure |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg PO | q12h | 400 mg/day | Avoid per institutional policy: CrCl <30, GI bleed risk, recent CV event, aspirin allergy |
| **Ketorolac (alt)** | 15 mg IV | q6h | 60 mg/day; ≤5 days | Conservative use; avoid higher-risk phenotypes per clinician judgment |
| **Meloxicam (alt)** | 7.5–15 mg PO | daily | 15 mg/day | NSAID precautions apply |

**NSAID decision-making:**
- Substantial opioid-sparing benefit when safe.
- Use high caution in renal impairment, high bleeding risk, significant CV disease, and concurrent anticoagulation; follow institutional pathways.

### Rescue Analgesia (Conservative)

| Protocol | First-Line Rescue | Dosing | Second-Line | Monitoring Requirements |
|----------|------------------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Protocol 1** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (reassess each dose) | Consider ketamine rescue per institutional protocol | Standard PACU monitoring; continuous SpO₂ |
| **Protocol 2** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (reassess each dose) | Consider ketamine rescue per institutional protocol | Continuous SpO₂; anticipate higher rescue needs |
| **Protocol 3** | Hydromorphone | 0.2–0.4 mg IV q15–20 min (titrate cautiously) | Reassess multimodal before escalation | **Mandatory continuous SpO₂**; consider capnography in high-risk |

**Elderly/frail/OSA rescue dosing:**
- Start hydromorphone **0.2 mg IV** with longer reassessment intervals (20–30 minutes).
- Lower threshold to prioritize non-opioid rescue modalities and monitoring escalation.

**Ketamine rescue analgesia (institution-dependent):**
- Typical sub-dissociative dose ~0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV.
- Apply ketamine contraindications and monitoring expectations.

---

## Postoperative Care Beyond PACU

### Floor Monitoring and Escalation (First 24-48 Hours)

**Standard Floor Care (All Protocols):**
- Vital signs per institutional pathway (typically q4h)
- Pain assessment with vital signs (NRS 0-10)
- RASS or equivalent sedation scoring
- Neurovascular checks q4h
- Early mobilization per PT protocol
- VTE prophylaxis per institutional guidelines

**Protocol-Specific Floor Requirements:**

| Protocol | Enhanced Monitoring | Escalation Triggers | Monitoring Duration |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Protocol 1** | Standard monitoring usually sufficient | • NRS >6 despite multimodal<br>• Block wearing off earlier than expected<br>• Signs of block complications | Until POD 1 morning (typical) |
| **Protocol 2** | Standard + pain reassessment q2h for first 8h | • NRS >6 despite multimodal + rescue<br>• Cumulative opioid rescue >30 MME in 24h | Until POD 1 evening (typical) |
| **Protocol 3** | **Enhanced:** q2h vitals/pain/sedation for first 12h | • Any RASS ≤-2<br>• RR <10 or SpO₂ <92%<br>• Cumulative opioid >40 MME in 24h<br>• PONV refractory to 2 agents | **Minimum 24h enhanced**, often 48h |

**When to Escalate to Monitored Bed (Step-Down/PCU):**

**Mandatory escalation for:**
- Naloxone requirement in PACU or floor
- Recurrent desaturation episodes (SpO₂ <90%)
- OSA/OHS with high opioid exposure (Protocol 3)
- Persistent oversedation (RASS ≤-2) despite intervention
- Respiratory rate <8 breaths/min at any time
- Concern from floor nursing team

**Consider escalation for:**
- Elderly/frail + Protocol 3 pathway
- Inadequate pain control requiring >30 MME/24h
- PONV requiring >2 rescue antiemetics
- Any unexpected clinical deterioration

### Discharge Planning

**Discharge Readiness Criteria (All Protocols):**
- [ ] Pain controlled with oral medications (NRS ≤4)
- [ ] No parenteral opioids required for ≥4 hours
- [ ] Able to ambulate 50-100 feet with walker/PT assistance
- [ ] No concerning sedation (RASS 0 to +1)
- [ ] PONV controlled or minimal
- [ ] Voiding adequate or catheter plan if needed
- [ ] Surgical site stable, no concerning drainage
- [ ] Patient/family education complete
- [ ] Home medications prescribed and reconciled
- [ ] Follow-up appointments scheduled

**Discharge Opioid Prescribing (Evidence-Based Stewardship):**

| Protocol | Typical Discharge Rx | Duration | Patient Counseling Points |
|----------|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Protocol 1** | Often none needed, or minimal (e.g., oxycodone 5mg #10-15 tabs) | 3-5 days maximum | • Regional blocks provided excellent early analgesia<br>• Most patients transition to non-opioid regimen by POD 2-3<br>• Take scheduled acetaminophen + NSAID first |
| **Protocol 2** | Short-term (e.g., oxycodone 5mg #15-20 tabs) | 5-7 days maximum | • Opioid-sparing approach maintained intraop<br>• Transition to non-opioid when pain <NRS 4<br>• Expect improvement by POD 3-5 |
| **Protocol 3** | Variable (e.g., oxycodone 5mg #20-30 tabs) | 7-10 days maximum | • Opioids used perioperatively; continue short-term<br>• Taper plan starting POD 5-7<br>• Goal: off opioids by POD 10-14 if possible<br>• Chronic users: coordinate with pain service |

**All Discharge Opioid Prescriptions Should Include:**
- Lowest effective dose (typically oxycodone 5 mg, NOT 10 mg)
- PRN dosing only (not scheduled)
- Counseling on constipation prophylaxis (senna + docusate)
- Safe storage and disposal instructions
- Clear instructions: "Take acetaminophen + NSAID FIRST for pain"
- Avoid driving/machinery operation while taking opioids
- Signs of oversedation requiring medical attention

**Special Population Discharge Considerations:**

**OSA patients:**
- Resume home CPAP/BiPAP immediately
- Extra caution with opioid prescriptions
- Lower threshold to prescribe non-opioid alternatives
- Consider home pulse oximetry monitoring

**Elderly/frail patients:**
- Minimize or avoid opioid prescriptions when possible
- Enhanced fall precautions at home
- Caregiver education on sedation monitoring
- Close outpatient follow-up (phone call POD 1-2)

**Chronic opioid users:**
- Resume baseline regimen immediately
- Avoid escalating baseline dose
- Pain service or PCP follow-up arranged
- Transition plan from acute to chronic pain management

## Clinical Outcomes Comparison (Directional Expectations)

| Outcome Measure | Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks) | Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) | Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pain control (0–24h)** | Excellent | Good–variable | Variable |
| **PONV risk** | Low | Low–moderate | Higher |
| **Sedation** | Minimal | Minimal–moderate | Moderate–higher; may be prolonged |
| **Time to mobilization** | Earlier | Early–moderate | Often delayed by PONV/sedation |
| **Delirium risk (elderly)** | Lower | Lower | Higher (multifactorial) |
| **Respiratory events** | Lower | Lower–moderate | Higher (dose/phenotype dependent) |
| **PACU LOS** | Shorter | Similar | Often longer |
| **Satisfaction** | High | Moderate–high | Variable |

---

## Monitoring Requirements by Protocol

### Intraoperative Monitoring (All Protocols - ASA Standard)

**Universal Requirements:**
- Continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, capnography (intubation to extubation)
- Blood pressure q3-5min (or continuous arterial line)
- Temperature (core or near-core)
- Inspired/expired gas analysis (O₂, volatile, CO₂)
- **Quantitative TOF monitoring** (mandatory when NMB used)

**Consider Adding:**
- Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy): elderly (>75), frail, cognitive impairment, depth control prioritized
- Arterial line: severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability, need for frequent ABGs

### PACU Monitoring Intensity by Protocol

| Monitoring Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Standard Duration** | 60-90 min | 90-120 min | 120-180 min (often longer) |
| **Continuous Pulse Oximetry** | Until stable (typically 60 min) | Until stable (typically 90 min) | **Mandatory continuous** until fully alert and stable |
| **Capnography** | • Consider: OSA, obesity<br>• Standard monitors usually sufficient | • Consider: OSA, obesity, high rescue opioid use<br>• Lower threshold than P1 | • **Strongly consider:** OSA/OHS, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, high exposure<br>• Standard of care for high-risk |
| **Vital Signs Frequency** | Q15min initially → Q30min when stable | Q15min initially → Q30min when stable | **Q10-15min** initially → Q15-30min when stable |
| **Sedation Assessment (RASS)** | Q30min | Q15-30min | **Q10-15min** initially |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Q15min | Q15min | **Q10min** initially; alert if <10/min |
| **Pain Assessment (NRS)** | Q15-30min | Q15-30min | Q15-30min |
| **Naloxone Readiness** | Available per routine | Available per routine | **At bedside, immediately accessible** |

### High-Risk Phenotype Monitoring Escalation

**For ANY protocol when high-risk features present:**

| Risk Factor | Additional Monitoring | Escalation Criteria |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | • Continuous pulse oximetry overnight<br>• Consider capnography in PACU<br>• Home CPAP resumed ASAP | Follow institutional OSA protocol |
| **Elderly (>75) or Frail** | • Enhanced sedation scoring (RASS q2h on floor)<br>• Lower threshold for monitored bed | If RASS ≤-2 or respiratory concern |
| **Opioid-Naïve + High Exposure** | • Continuous pulse oximetry until fully alert<br>• Frequent RR assessment | Per institutional opioid monitoring policy |
| **Recurrent Desaturation** | • **Escalate to monitored bed**<br>• Consider capnography<br>• Respiratory therapy consult | **Do NOT discharge to unmonitored floor** |
| **Oversedation (RASS ≤-2)** | • Reduce/hold opioids<br>• Consider naloxone if respiratory compromise<br>• Escalate monitoring | Notify attending; consider ICU if severe |
| **Naloxone Requirement** | • **Mandatory monitored bed**<br>• Continuous monitoring<br>• Incident reporting | Follow institutional critical event protocol |

---

## Monitoring Requirements by Protocol

> **Monitoring intensity escalates from Protocol 1 → 2 → 3** based on increased risk of sedation and respiratory complications.

### Intraoperative Monitoring (All Protocols - ASA Standard)

**Universal Requirements:**
- Continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, capnography (intubation to extubation)
- Blood pressure q3-5min (or continuous arterial line)
- Temperature (core or near-core)
- Inspired/expired gas analysis (O₂, volatile, CO₂)
- **Quantitative TOF monitoring** (mandatory when NMB used)

**Consider Adding:**
- Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy): elderly (>75), frail, cognitive impairment, depth control prioritized
- Arterial line: severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability, need for frequent ABGs

---

### Protocol-Specific Monitoring Considerations

**Protocol 1 (OFIA + Blocks):**
- Standard ASA monitoring usually sufficient
- Watch for LAST signs if large-volume infiltration also used
- Verify blocks working (sensation testing) before declaring pain crisis
- Lipid emulsion immediately available when blocks performed

**Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free):**
- Higher rescue opioid use → lower threshold for enhanced monitoring
- If cumulative hydromorphone >1mg in PACU, consider capnography
- Track total LA burden (surgeon infiltration + any IV lidocaine infusion)
- Anticipate longer PACU stays than Protocol 1

**Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) - CRITICAL:**
- **Most stringent monitoring requirements**
- Continuous pulse oximetry is **not optional** until patient meets ALL criteria:
  - Fully awake (RASS 0 to +1)
  - Robust ventilation (RR 10-20, SpO₂ >94% on room air)
  - Minimal sedation (conversational, appropriate affect)
- **Do NOT discharge to unmonitored floor bed if:**
  - OSA/OHS with opioid exposure
  - Elderly/frail with somnolence
  - Any naloxone requirement
  - Recurrent desaturation episodes
  - Concern from PACU team

### PACU Monitoring Intensity by Protocol

| Monitoring Component | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 | Protocol 3 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Standard Duration** | 60-90 min | 90-120 min | 120-180 min (often longer) |
| **Continuous Pulse Oximetry** | Until stable (typically 60 min) | Until stable (typically 90 min) | **Mandatory continuous** until fully alert and stable |
| **Capnography** | • Consider: OSA, obesity<br>• Standard monitors usually sufficient | • Consider: OSA, obesity, high rescue opioid use<br>• Lower threshold than P1 | • **Strongly consider:** OSA/OHS, elderly/frail, opioid-naïve, high exposure<br>• Standard of care for high-risk |
| **Vital Signs Frequency** | Q15min initially → Q30min when stable | Q15min initially → Q30min when stable | **Q10-15min** initially → Q15-30min when stable |
| **Sedation Assessment (RASS)** | Q30min | Q15-30min | **Q10-15min** initially |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Q15min | Q15min | **Q10min** initially; alert if <10/min |
| **Pain Assessment (NRS)** | Q15-30min | Q15-30min | Q15-30min |
| **Naloxone Readiness** | Available per routine | Available per routine | **At bedside, immediately accessible** |

### High-Risk Phenotype Monitoring Escalation

**For ANY protocol when high-risk features present:**

| Risk Factor | Additional Monitoring | Escalation Criteria |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | • Continuous pulse oximetry overnight<br>• Consider capnography in PACU<br>• Home CPAP resumed ASAP | Follow institutional OSA protocol |
| **Elderly (>75) or Frail** | • Enhanced sedation scoring (RASS q2h on floor)<br>• Lower threshold for monitored bed | If RASS ≤-2 or respiratory concern |
| **Opioid-Naïve + High Exposure** | • Continuous pulse oximetry until fully alert<br>• Frequent RR assessment | Per institutional opioid monitoring policy |
| **Recurrent Desaturation** | • **Escalate to monitored bed**<br>• Consider capnography<br>• Respiratory therapy consult | **Do NOT discharge to unmonitored floor** |
| **Oversedation (RASS ≤-2)** | • Reduce/hold opioids<br>• Consider naloxone if respiratory compromise<br>• Escalate monitoring | Notify attending; consider ICU if severe |
| **Naloxone Requirement** | • **Mandatory monitored bed**<br>• Continuous monitoring<br>• Incident reporting | Follow institutional critical event protocol |

---

### Floor Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**All Protocols (Minimum Standard):**
- Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, temp) per institutional pathway (typically q4h)
- Pain assessment with each vital sign check
- Sedation assessment with each vital sign check (RASS or equivalent)
- Neurovascular checks q4h (distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, motor)

**Protocol 3 Enhanced Requirements:**
- Consider continuous pulse oximetry overnight for OSA/high-risk patients
- Enhanced sedation monitoring (q2h) for first 8-12 hours
- Lower threshold for step-down/ICU bed if concerning features develop
- Document monitoring plan in transfer orders

## Contraindications and Safety Considerations

### Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) – Avoid When:
**Absolute contraindications to blocks:**
- Patient refusal after informed consent
- Infection at site/systemic sepsis
- Anticoagulation outside ASRA + institutional windows
- Known anaphylaxis to amide local anesthetics

**Adjunct precautions:**
- Ketamine: active psychosis; avoid severe uncontrolled HTN per judgment
- Dexmedetomidine: high-grade AV block without pacemaker; symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension
- Magnesium: CrCl <30, myasthenia gravis, advanced AV block

### Protocol 2 (OFIA Block-Free) – Avoid When:
- Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated and opioid-sparing cannot be safely implemented
- Institutional resources for OFIA monitoring/support are not available
- Shared decision-making favors opioid-inclusive pathway

### Protocol 3 (Opioid-Inclusive) – Avoid When Possible In:
- Severe/untreated OSA or OHS
- COPD with hypercapnia/home oxygen
- Prior postoperative respiratory failure
- Frail elderly, baseline cognitive impairment, prior POD
- Severe opioid-associated PONV history
- Patient preference for opioid-sparing approach

**If Protocol 3 is used in high-risk phenotypes:**
- Use lowest effective opioid doses, early taper, avoid stacking.
- Implement explicit enhanced monitoring plan.

## ASRA/ESRA Anticoagulation Timing (Reference Framework — Verify Current Guidance)

**Applies to:** Deep peripheral nerve blocks (ACB, IPACK) in Protocols 1 and 3

> **Critical:** This table is directional guidance only. Always consult:
> 1. Current ASRA/ESRA guidance
> 2. Institutional anticoagulation protocols (supersede)
> 3. Patient-specific factors: renal function, true dosing, interactions

### Preoperative Holds (Time Before Block)

| Anticoagulant | CrCl >50 | CrCl 30–50 | CrCl <30 | Notes |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|-------|
| **DOACs** (apixaban/rivaroxaban/edoxaban) | ≥72h | ≥96h | ≥120h | Verify last dose timing; drug levels if available per institution |
| **Dabigatran** | ≥72h | ≥96h | ≥120h | More renal dependence; longer holds in renal impairment |
| **Warfarin** | INR per institution (often ≤1.4) | Same | Same | Verify INR day-of per policy |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24h | ≥24h | Consult hematology | Higher bleeding risk |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥12h | ≥12h | Often ≥24h | Institutional variability |
| **UFH prophylaxis** | 4–6h | 4–6h | 4–6h | Verify aPTT if therapeutic |
| **Aspirin** | No hold | No hold | No hold | Peripheral block permissive guidance; institutional policies apply |
| **Clopidogrel** | 5–7d | 5–7d | 5–7d | Institutional variability; verify local policy |
| **NSAIDs** | No hold | No hold | No hold | Peripheral block permissive guidance; institutional policies apply |

### Postoperative Restart (After Block)

| Anticoagulant | Minimum Time | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|------|
| **DOACs / Dabigatran** | ≥6h (single-shot) | Often longer per institution and bleeding risk |
| **Warfarin** | Per surgical/medicine plan | Commonly evening of surgery/POD1 |
| **Therapeutic LMWH** | ≥24h | High bleeding risk; verify with surgical team |
| **Prophylactic LMWH** | ≥6–12h | Institutional variability |
| **Aspirin/NSAIDs** | Continue | No hold typically required |
| **Clopidogrel** | Per institutional/cardiology plan | Verify |

**Documentation requirements:**
- Last anticoagulant dose time, renal function, institutional compliance verification, and risk/benefit discussion when non-standard.

## Key Clinical Pearls

### General Principles
1. **Propofol induction (1.5–2 mg/kg) is standard**; reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg with slow titration in elderly/frail/severe cardiac disease.
2. **Protocol 1 is first-line when feasible:** best early analgesia with opioid-sparing physiology.
3. **Protocol 2 preserves opioid-sparing benefit without blocks** but expect more variable analgesia and higher rescue needs than Protocol 1.
4. **Protocol 3 is a fallback pathway:** conservative opioid use, early taper, and monitoring escalation are mandatory.

### Dosing and Adjuncts
5. **Dexmedetomidine:** infusion-first; avoid bolus loading due to bradycardia/hypotension risk.
6. **Magnesium:** potentiates NMBD; quantitative TOF monitoring is essential.
7. **Ketamine:** alters processed EEG indices; do not titrate hypnosis to BIS alone when ketamine is used.

### Monitoring and Emergence
8. **TOF ratio ≥0.9 before extubation** is non-negotiable.
9. **Protocol 3 requires stricter extubation criteria** and lower threshold to delay extubation in OSA/elderly/frail or higher opioid exposure.
10. **LAST preparedness** is mandatory whenever regional blocks are performed.

## Document Validation Statement

This protocol comparison table is revised to reflect conservative dosing, phenotype-based risk controls, and pathway selection logic aligned with ERAS principles, ASA monitoring standards, and ASRA/ESRA regional anesthesia safety frameworks. It is intended to support structured clinical reasoning and multidisciplinary quality improvement discussions; it does not establish a standard of care.

**Limitations:**
- Educational framework only; requires institutional adaptation and clinician judgment.
- Dosing and timing require patient-specific titration and local policy alignment.
- Practice variation is expected and appropriate when evidence-based.

**Scope:**
- Adult elective robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty.
- Not intended for emergency surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, or non-TKA orthopedic procedures without modification.

**Version control:**
- Review semi-annually or upon major guideline updates or safety signals.

## End of Document

**Remember:** This protocol represents a synthesis of current evidence and expert consensus to guide clinical decision-making. It is not a substitute for clinical judgment, individualized patient assessment, or institutional oversight. Safe anesthetic care requires qualified practitioners, appropriate resources, ongoing education, and commitment to continuous quality improvement.

**Patient safety is paramount.** When in doubt, consult senior colleagues, review primary literature, and prioritize conservative approaches that minimize risk while optimizing outcomes.

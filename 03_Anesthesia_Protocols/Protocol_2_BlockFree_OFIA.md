# Protocol 2 – Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) Without Nerve Blocks (rTKA)

Block-free opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) when regional blocks are not feasible or not desired. This protocol aims to preserve the benefits of OFIA (reduced opioid exposure, smoother recovery profile in many patients, and ERAS-aligned early mobilization) by relying on multimodal systemic adjuncts and **surgeon periarticular infiltration** instead of ACB/IPACK.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS 2024, ASA/APSF 2024, and ASRA 2024–2025 guidance but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized, especially in elderly, frail, OSA, or significant comorbidity.  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Dose adjustments and contraindications for special populations are detailed in:  
>   **`Protocol_Adjuncts_and_Contraindications.md`** and should be applied here.  
> - This protocol uses **conservative guardrails** to reduce misuse risk.

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthetic without nerve blocks** for rTKA. It is generally used when:

- The patient **declines nerve blocks** after counseling.
- **ASRA timing** prevents safe ACB/IPACK (e.g., DOAC/LMWH timing outside appropriate windows).
- **Rapid workflow is required** and block placement would unduly delay the case.
- **Anatomical difficulties** (e.g., limited ultrasound windows, prior surgery) make blocks difficult or unsafe.

> **Position in Algorithm:**  
> - When feasible, **Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK)** is generally preferred first-line.  
> - When regional blocks are not feasible but OFIA components are appropriate, **Protocol 2** is typically preferred over a conventional opioid-based pathway (Protocol 3).

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment

- Comprehensive history and exam:
  - ASA classification, airway exam, functional capacity/METs, allergies.
- **Opioid history:**
  - Document chronic opioid use (drug, dose, MME/day).
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV history.
  - Frailty/cognition (especially elderly).
  - OSA screening (STOP-Bang, home CPAP/BiPAP use).
- Anticoagulation:
  - Explicitly document **why blocks are not being performed** (ASRA timing, patient refusal, workflow, anatomy, attending decision).
- **Screen for ketamine caution contexts** (see Section 3.4): hemodynamic instability, frailty/advanced age, tachyarrhythmia risk, catecholamine-depleted physiology, severe psychiatric disease.

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed)

Typical adult regimen (individualize for renal/hepatic function and comorbidities):

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO**  
  - 30–60 minutes pre-op (max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease or low body weight).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO**  
  - 1–2 hours pre-op, if no significant renal/CV or GI contraindication.  
  - Alternative: **Meloxicam 15 mg PO** per institutional guidance.
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV**  
  - After IV placement (PONV prophylaxis + analgesic synergy).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch**  
  - Evening prior or ≥2 hours pre-op for **high PONV risk** patients without contraindications.
- **Midazolam 0.5–2 mg IV PRN** (anxiolysis; lowest effective dose)  
  - Consider **≤1 mg** in frail/elderly/OSA; avoid in significant baseline cognitive impairment when possible.  
  - If midazolam is used pre-op, avoid routine “repeat” dosing at induction.
- **Continue home opioid dose** morning of surgery for **chronic opioid users** per attending/pain guidance (continuation of baseline therapy does not violate the OFIA *intraoperative* goal).
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** (sedation/delirium/respiratory risk in select populations; apply institutional policy).

### 2.3 Documentation and Surgeon Coordination

- In the pre-op note, explicitly document:  
  - “**Block omitted due to**: ____ (anticoagulation timing, patient refusal, workflow constraints, anatomical difficulty, attending decision).”
- Confirm with surgeon:
  - **Periarticular infiltration will be performed** as a critical component of this pathway.
  - Record planned local anesthetic **concentration, volume, additives**, and confirm responsibility for documenting totals.
- Ensure a plan to track **cumulative local anesthetic dose** and LAST readiness.

## 3. Induction

> Doses below are **typical adult ranges** for otherwise stable patients; reduce in frail, elderly, and hemodynamically unstable patients.

### 3.1 Pre-Oxygenation
- 100% FiO₂ via tight-fitting mask for **3–5 minutes** before induction.

### 3.2 Induction Sequence (Propofol-Based; OFIA)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (**primary hypnotic**)  
  - Consider **~1–1.5 mg/kg** in frail/cardiac patients.
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
  - Dose to ideal/adjusted body weight and confirm depth with TOF.
- **Midazolam 0–0.5 mg IV** *only if needed*  
  - Often omit if pre-op dose already given.

### 3.3 Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct — Not Default Induction Agent)
Ketamine is presented as an **optional sub-anesthetic adjunct** for opioid-sparing analgesia (not a default primary induction agent). Effects are context-dependent.

**Dose (if used):**
- **Ketamine 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (titrate to effect; lower end favored in elderly/frail or hemodynamically fragile patients)

### 3.4 Ketamine Guardrails (Patient Selection, Hemodynamics, BIS/EEG)
**Use caution, reduce dose, or omit** ketamine bolus/infusion when any of the following are present (non-exhaustive):
- **Hemodynamic instability** or escalating vasopressor requirement; suspected catecholamine-depleted physiology
- **Frailty / advanced age** with limited physiologic reserve (higher delirium/prolonged recovery risk)
- Clinically significant **tachyarrhythmia risk** or contexts where sympathetic stimulation is undesirable
- Severe psychiatric disease with active psychosis (context-dependent)

**Depth monitoring caveat:** Ketamine can **increase BIS** and alter EEG-derived indices. Avoid titrating hypnotics to BIS alone after ketamine; correlate with clinical signs and raw EEG trends when available.

### 3.5 Optional Adjunct Initiation (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine:** prefer **infusion without routine loading bolus** in most patients  
  - If started early: **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (lower end favored in elderly/frail; avoid bolus in fragile patients)
- **Magnesium sulfate 30–50 mg/kg IV over 15–20 minutes**  
  - Avoid if **CrCl <30 mL/min**.

### 3.6 Airway Management
- ETT vs LMA choice based on:
  - Surgical requirements, aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, positioning.
- Confirm placement:
  - **Continuous ETCO₂ waveform** ± auscultation per institutional practice.
- Document airway details:
  - Cormack–Lehane grade (if intubated), adjuncts used, and any complications.

## 4. Maintenance

### 4.1 Primary Maintenance (Propofol Default; Sevo Optional/Additive)
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (**default maintenance strategy**)  
- **Optional sevoflurane 0.5–1.2 MAC** may be added selectively (case length/complexity, workflow, emergence strategy, institutional preference)

> The intent is to keep propofol explicitly present as the maintenance backbone while acknowledging that sevoflurane is frequently used as an adjunct in some workflows.

### 4.2 Adjunct Infusions (Selection-Dependent; Apply Guardrails)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr**  
  - Use **0.2–0.4** in elderly/frail/bradycardic patients  
  - Avoid bolus loading in fragile patients; reduce/stop if hypotension/bradycardia persists
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr** *optional*  
  - Favor lower end or omit in frail/elderly or unstable patients  
- **Optional: Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr** (institutional limits apply)  
  - Respect total dose ceilings and contraindications (e.g., significant hepatic dysfunction, conduction disease); monitor for CNS toxicity.

> **Key Principle:**  
> **No intraoperative opioids** are given in this pathway. Postoperative opioid rescue remains available when clinically indicated.

### 4.3 Hemodynamic Management
- **Target MAP ≥65 mmHg**, individualized for CAD or cerebrovascular disease.
- Typical vasopressor strategy (institutional practice):
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** if hypotension with HR >70.
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** if hypotension with HR <60.
- **Dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia/hypotension:**
  - Reduce/stop dex infusion if recurrent  
  - **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** for symptomatic bradycardia per local protocol.

### 4.4 Intraoperative Monitoring
- Standard ASA monitors:
  - ECG, NIBP or arterial line (per risk), SpO₂, ETCO₂, temperature.
- Neuromuscular monitoring:
  - TOF to guide rocuronium dosing and reversal.
- Volatile agent analyzer if sevoflurane used.
- Consider depth-of-anesthesia monitoring (e.g., BIS) in elderly/frail, with ketamine caveat above.

---

## 5. Emergence

### 5.1 Late Intraoperative Period (10–15 Minutes Before End)
- Reduce/stop dexmedetomidine as tolerated.
- If ketamine infusion used, plan stop at closure.
- Stop lidocaine infusion if used (per institutional practice).

### 5.2 At Skin Closure
- Stop ketamine infusion (if used).
- Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing.
- If sevoflurane used, taper toward **~0.5–0.7 MAC** as tolerated.

### 5.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV**.
- Neuromuscular reversal (institutional policy):
  - **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV** when TOF count ≥2 but TOF ratio <0.9.
  - **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV** for deeper block.

### 5.4 Extubation Criteria
- Awake/easily arousable; follows commands.
- Adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
- Objective neuromuscular recovery (TOF ratio ≥0.9).
- Hemodynamic stability.

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia Plan (Block-Free)

### 6.1 Surgeon Periarticular Infiltration (Critical Component)
Because this pathway is **block-free**, surgeon periarticular infiltration is **essential**.

- Document:
  - Total **volume**, **concentration**, and **total mg** of local anesthetic.
  - Any additives (e.g., epinephrine, ketorolac) per institutional practice.
- **Dose safety:**
  - Track **cumulative local anesthetic dose** and follow institutional limits.
  - This repository uses a **conservative weight-based framing** (e.g., ropivacaine **~3 mg/kg** as a common reference), recognizing that some LIA practices use higher totals under specific institutional protocols.
  - If planned volume/concentration exceeds conservative weight-based totals, explicitly document that the plan follows **institutional LIA protocol** and that LAST preparedness is verified.

> **LAST preparedness** (20% lipid emulsion and response pathway) must be confirmed whenever high-volume infiltration is used.

### 6.2 Expected PACU Pain Scores
- Without blocks, early pain is typically higher than Protocol 1.
- Pre-op counseling should set expectations and explain rescue options.

### 6.3 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h** (max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease/low weight).
- NSAID per institutional policy (if no contraindication).

### 6.4 Rescue Analgesia (Stepwise; Apply Guardrails)
1. **Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 minutes PRN** (max ~3 boluses)  
   - **Omit/reduce** in frail/elderly, unstable hemodynamics, or tachyarrhythmia risk (see guardrails).
2. **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 minutes PRN** if inadequate response and clinically appropriate  
   - Enhanced respiratory monitoring, especially in elderly/OSA/opioid-naïve patients.

## 7. Notes, Clinical Context, and Contraindications

### 7.1 Expected Differences vs Protocol 1 (Blocks)
- Higher early pain scores and more frequent PACU rescue needs are common.
- Outcomes are strongly dependent on high-quality periarticular infiltration plus systemic multimodal therapy.

### 7.2 Key Principles (Protocol 2)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** is the default induction hypnotic across rTKA pathways (titrate to physiology).
- **Propofol TIVA** is the default maintenance backbone; **sevoflurane** is an optional/additive maintenance component depending on workflow.
- Ketamine and dexmedetomidine are **optional** and must follow **selection/guardrails**, particularly in frail/elderly or hemodynamically unstable patients.
- Postoperative opioid rescue is available when clinically indicated and does not mean the OFIA strategy has “failed.”

### 7.3 When to Avoid Protocol 2
Consider switching to **Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid Pathway)** or a fully individualized plan if:
- Adjunct contraindications make OFIA components inappropriate (e.g., clinically significant hemodynamic instability where dex/ketamine are undesirable).
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) when magnesium avoidance is required and alternative adjunct strategy is not desired.
- Attending anesthesiologist determines an opioid-based pathway is safer or more appropriate for the specific physiology and monitoring environment.

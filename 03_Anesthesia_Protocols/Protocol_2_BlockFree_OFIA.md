## 1. Purpose and Clinical Context

### 1.1 Protocol Objectives

This protocol provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway WITHOUT regional nerve blocks** for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) that:

- **Maintains opioid-free intraoperative strategy** despite absence of regional blocks
- **Relies on systemic multimodal adjuncts** (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine infusion, magnesium)
- **Utilizes surgeon periarticular infiltration** as primary regional analgesia component
- **Reduces PONV** through opioid-sparing and propofol-based strategies
- **Supports ERAS goals** including early mobilization (POD 0 within 4–8 hours)
- **Provides alternative when blocks contraindicated** or refused

### 1.2 Evidence Base

This protocol is informed by:
- ERAS Society Guidelines for Hip and Knee Arthroplasty (2019, 2024 updates)
- ASA/APSF perioperative safety communications (2024)
- SAMBA Consensus Statement on Opioid-Free Anesthesia (2020)
- Current peer-reviewed literature on systemic multimodal analgesia and lidocaine infusions

**Complete evidence grading and citations:** See `../../07_References_Evidence_2024.md`

### 1.3 When to Use This Protocol

**Preferred when:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (blocks contraindicated) → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Patient refuses regional blocks after informed consent → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Body habitus prevents adequate ultrasound visualization for blocks
- Severe peripheral neuropathy affecting surgical extremity
- Prior surgery distorting anatomy (difficult block placement)
- Workflow constraints (time, equipment, personnel availability)
- Attending/institutional preference for block-free OFIA approach

**Position in Algorithm:**
- When blocks feasible and safe → **Protocol 1** (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) preferred
- When blocks NOT feasible but OFIA appropriate → **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free) preferred over Protocol 3
- When OFIA adjuncts contraindicated → **Protocol 3** (opioid-inclusive)

### 1.4 Key Difference from Protocol 1

**Protocol 2 vs Protocol 1:**
- **No ACB/IPACK blocks** → Higher expected pain (NRS 2–5 vs 0–3)
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration** is CRITICAL component
- **May include lidocaine infusion** as additional systemic adjunct
- **Faster workflow** (no block placement time)
- **More PACU rescue needs** anticipated and planned for
- **Still opioid-sparing** - zero intraoperative opioids

---

## 2. Patient Selection Criteria

### 2.1 Ideal Candidates

**Strongly preferred for:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (most common indication)
- Patient refusal of regional blocks despite counseling
- High PONV risk (OFIA + propofol strategy still beneficial)
- OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3) - opioid-sparing still critical even without blocks
- Age >75 years when opioid minimization advantageous
- Body habitus preventing adequate block placement
- Prior surgery distorting regional anatomy

### 2.2 When Protocol 2 is CONTRAINDICATED (Use Protocol 3 Instead)

**Consider Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive) when:**
- **Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated:**
  - Active psychosis (ketamine contraindicated)
  - High-grade AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine contraindicated)
  - Severe hepatic impairment (lidocaine contraindicated)
  - CrCl <30 mL/min (magnesium contraindicated)
- **Hemodynamic instability** where adjuncts may worsen status
- **Severe cardiac disease** where dexmedetomidine/ketamine poorly tolerated
- **Attending judgment** that opioid-based approach safer for specific patient

**OFIA adjunct contraindications summary:**

| Adjunct | Absolute Contraindications | Relative Contraindications |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ketamine** | Active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN (SBP >180); acute globe injury | Frailty; hemodynamic instability; catecholamine-depleted physiology; age >85 |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-grade AV block without pacemaker; severe baseline bradycardia (HR <50) | Age >75; severe cardiac disease; baseline hypotension |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Severe hepatic impairment; complete heart block; amide LA allergy; severe cardiac conduction disease | Hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B/C); seizure history |
| **Magnesium** | CrCl <30 mL/min; myasthenia gravis; complete heart block | Renal impairment (CrCl 30-50); risk of prolonged NMB |

### 2.3 Special Populations

**Elderly (>75 years):**
- Reduce all medication doses by 25–40%
- Midazolam: 0.5 mg maximum
- Propofol induction: 1–1.5 mg/kg
- Dexmedetomidine: 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum
- Ketamine: 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or omit
- Lidocaine: 1 mg/kg/hr maximum
- Enhanced emergence and PACU monitoring

**Frail patients:**
- Similar reductions as elderly
- Lower threshold to omit ketamine and lidocaine infusion
- Prioritize propofol TIVA over sevoflurane (better control)
- Extended PACU observation
- Lower threshold for monitored bed postoperatively

**OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3):**
- Protocol 2 is **appropriate** (opioid-sparing maintained)
- **BUT:** Anticipate higher rescue opioid needs in PACU than Protocol 1
- Ensure continuous pulse oximetry in PACU/floor
- Consider capnography in PACU
- Lower threshold for monitored bed

**Severe cardiac disease:**
- Careful hemodynamic management essential
- Phenylephrine infusion may be needed
- Consider arterial line
- Dexmedetomidine use with extreme caution (risk of bradycardia/hypotension)
- Lower threshold to omit dexmedetomidine and use opioid-based approach (Protocol 3)

**Chronic opioid use:**
- Protocol 2 still appropriate (continue home regimen)
- Anticipate **significantly higher** PACU rescue needs than Protocol 1
- May need Protocol 3 if very high tolerance (>120 MME/day) or if analgesia inadequate

---

## 3. Preoperative Phase

### 3.1 Preanesthetic Assessment

**Standard evaluation:**
- Complete history and physical examination
- Airway assessment (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck mobility)
- Review prior anesthesia records (complications, PONV, difficult airway, delirium)
- ASA physical status classification
- NPO status verification

**Risk factor identification:**
- **OSA:** STOP-Bang score
- **PONV risk:** Apfel score (female, non-smoker, hx PONV/motion sickness, postop opioids)
- **Frailty:** Clinical Frailty Scale or simple assessment (gait speed, grip strength)
- **Cognitive impairment:** Baseline mental status, prior delirium
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Functional capacity, recent stress testing, medication reconciliation
- **Renal function:** Creatinine clearance calculation (Cockcroft-Gault)
- **Hepatic function:** LFTs, synthetic function (important for lidocaine infusion safety)

**Chronic medication reconciliation:**
- **Opioids:** Document baseline regimen; continue morning dose
- **Anticoagulation:** Document why blocks not performed (see Section 3.2)
- **Cardiovascular medications:** Continue beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors (hold ARBs per institutional policy)
- **Psychiatric medications:** Continue SSRIs, antipsychotics; note ketamine interactions

### 3.2 Documentation of Block Omission

**Critical documentation requirement:**
In preoperative note, **explicitly document reason blocks NOT performed:**

| Reason | Documentation Example |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Anticoagulation timing** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, last dose 48 hours ago (ASRA requires ≥72h for deep peripheral blocks). Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Patient refusal** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient declined regional blocks after discussion of risks/benefits. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Anatomy/body habitus** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: BMI 52, unable to obtain adequate ultrasound visualization. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Prior surgery** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Prior femoral vascular surgery distorting anatomy. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Workflow constraints** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Time constraints and OR availability. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) per attending decision." |

### 3.3 Surgeon Coordination for Periarticular Infiltration

> **CRITICAL:** Surgeon periarticular infiltration is the ONLY regional analgesia component in Protocol 2. This MUST be performed for adequate pain control.

**Pre-case discussion with surgeon:**
- [ ] Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular local anesthetic infiltration (LIA)
- [ ] Verify typical volume and concentration (e.g., 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2%)
- [ ] Ensure surgeon will document: drug(s), concentration(s), volume(s), total dose (mg)
- [ ] Plan for cumulative local anesthetic dose tracking

**Typical surgeon periarticular infiltration:**
- **Ropivacaine 0.2%, 100–150 mL** injected into posterior capsule, medial/lateral soft tissues, periosteum
- **Total ropivacaine dose:** 200–300 mg (higher than Protocol 1 blocks, still below toxic threshold)
- **Expected duration:** 6–12 hours (shorter than ACB/IPACK)

**LAST preparedness still required:**
- 20% lipid emulsion immediately available in OR and PACU
- LAST treatment protocol posted
- Team trained in LAST recognition and management
- Monitor for signs/symptoms (perioral numbness, tinnitus, seizures, cardiovascular collapse)

### 3.4 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed Multimodal Foundation)

**Timing: 60–90 minutes before anticipated incision**

| Medication | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | PO | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | **Contraindications:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke, aspirin allergy<br>Alternative: Meloxicam 15 mg PO |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8–10 mg | IV | After IV access obtained; reduce to 4–6 mg if diabetic (monitor glucose) |

**Additional preoperative considerations:**

| Medication | Indication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Scopolamine patch** | High PONV risk only (Apfel ≥3) | 1.5 mg transdermal | Apply evening prior or ≥4 hours preop<br>**Contraindicated:** Narrow-angle glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | Anxiolysis if needed | 0.5–2 mg IV | Reduce to 0.5 mg or avoid in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | **NOT recommended** | — | Risk of sedation, delirium, respiratory depression outweighs benefit |
| **Home opioids** | Chronic opioid use | Baseline dose | Continue morning dose; do not escalate preoperatively |

**Documentation:**
- All preoperative medications given with timing
- Any medications held and rationale
- Allergies and adverse drug reactions verified

---

## 4. Induction

> **Induction achieves rapid, reliable loss of consciousness using propofol bolus.** Adjuncts are used to blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, NOT to replace hypnosis.

### 4.1 Pre-Induction Checklist

**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Patient correctly identified, procedure verified (Time Out)
- [ ] ASA standard monitors applied and functioning
- [ ] IV access confirmed patent (consider 2nd IV for infusions)
- [ ] Airway equipment prepared and checked
- [ ] Anesthesia machine checkout complete
- [ ] Suction functioning
- [ ] Vasoactive medications drawn and labeled (phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine)
- [ ] Intubation equipment ready (video laryngoscope preferred)
- [ ] Difficult airway cart available
- [ ] Team briefing complete
- [ ] **Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular infiltration**

### 4.2 Induction Medications

> **See Also:** [Protocol Comparison Table - Induction](Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#induction-conservative-adult-dosing) for complete dosing table and special population adjustments.

#### Optional: Lidocaine for Injection Pain

**Indication:** Reduce propofol injection discomfort

| Patient Population | Dose | Timing | Notes |
|-------------------|------|--------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 20–40 mg IV (0.5 mg/kg) | Immediately before propofol | Flush with 5 mL NS before propofol |
| **Elderly/frail** | 20 mg IV | Immediately before propofol | Optional; not required |

**Important:** This is **NOT** systemic lidocaine infusion (see Section 5.2)

#### Primary Induction: Propofol

**Propofol is the hypnotic agent for induction in Protocol 2.**

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Expected Effect |
|-------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard adult** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 30–60 seconds | LOC in 30–45 seconds |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Frail** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 90–120 seconds | LOC in 60–90 seconds; anticipate hypotension |
| **Hypovolemia suspected** | **1–1.2 mg/kg IV** | Very slow push | Aggressive vasopressor readiness |

**Critical Safety:**
- **Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension**
- **Ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue:**
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (if HR adequate)
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** (if HR <60)
  - **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** (if severe hypotension)
- Have vasopressor drawn and ready BEFORE injecting propofol
- Anticipate hypotension in elderly, frail, severe cardiac disease, hypovolemia

#### Neuromuscular Blockade

**Rocuronium for intubation:**

| Dose | Timing | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** | After LOC confirmed | Dose to **ideal body weight** in obesity |
| Typical: 50–70 mg | Immediately after propofol | Intubation conditions at 60–90 seconds |

**Critical:** TOF monitoring is **mandatory** (see Section 8.3)

#### Optional: Midazolam

**Only if needed for additional anxiolysis:**

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 0–1 mg IV | Often omitted if already dosed preoperatively |
| **Elderly (>75)** | 0–0.5 mg IV | **Avoid if possible**; high delirium risk |
| **Frail/OSA** | **Avoid** | Respiratory depression risk |

**Decision point:** If midazolam 1–2 mg already given preoperatively → **omit at induction**

### 4.3 Optional Adjunct Boluses

> **Adjuncts blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, but do NOT replace hypnosis.**

#### Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct)

**Indication:** Opioid-sparing analgesia, blunt intubation response, NMDA antagonism

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | **0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (14–35 mg for 70 kg) | **Higher end (0.5 mg/kg) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | High delirium risk |
| **Frail** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | Hemodynamic fragility |
| **Hemodynamic instability** | **Omit** | Risk outweighs benefit |
| **Severe tachyarrhythmia risk** | **Omit** | Sympathetic stimulation undesirable |

**EEG monitoring caveat:**
- Ketamine may **increase BIS** and alter EEG-derived indices
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine administration
- Correlate with clinical context and raw EEG trends when available

### 4.4 Optional Adjunct Infusion Initiation

#### Dexmedetomidine Infusion

**Indication:** Sedation, sympatholysis, opioid-sparing analgesia

**Critical:** **NO loading dose** (bolus increases bradycardia/hypotension risk)

| Patient Population | Infusion Rate | Start Timing |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Standard adult** | **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** | After intubation |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (lower end) | After intubation |
| **Frail** | **0.2–0.3 mcg/kg/hr** | After intubation |
| **Cardiac disease** | **0.2–0.3 mcg/kg/hr** with caution | After intubation; close HR/BP monitoring |

- Anticipate **prolonged paralysis**
- TOF monitoring is **essential**
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

## 5. Maintenance Anesthesia

> **Maintenance ensures continuous unconsciousness while OFIA adjuncts provide analgesia and sympatholysis.**

### 5.1 Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity

**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by propofol and/or sevoflurane.**

> **Cross-Reference:** See [Protocol Comparison Table - Maintenance Anesthesia](Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#maintenance-anesthesia) for complete options and detailed safety profiles.

**Choose ONE of the following hypnotic strategies:**

#### Option A: Propofol TIVA (Preferred for Protocol 2)

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to depth monitors) | Antiemetic properties; precise control; MH-safe |
| **Monitoring** | Consider processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in elderly/frail | Reduces risk of excessive depth |
| **Preferred When** | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; institutional preference | Best for Protocol 2 goals |

#### Option B: Sevoflurane

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **0.7–1 MAC** (age-adjusted; see table below) | Familiar; easy titration; rapid offset |
| **Monitoring** | End-tidal agent monitoring | Standard volatile technique |
| **Preferred When** | Standard workflow; not high PONV risk; volatile-capable machine | Widely available |

**Age-Adjusted MAC Reduction for Sevoflurane:**

| Age Range | MAC Reduction | Effective MAC Range |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Age 65–75** | Reduce by ~20% | 0.56–0.8 MAC |
| **Age 75–85** | Reduce by ~30–40% | 0.42–0.7 MAC |
| **Age >85** | Reduce by ~40–50% | 0.35–0.6 MAC |

#### Option C: Balanced (Propofol + Sevoflurane)

| Component | Details | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Dosing** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + Sevoflurane 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce total dose of each |
| **Complexity** | More challenging titration | Requires experience with hybrid technique |
| **Preferred When** | Institutional preference or specific clinical scenarios | Not routine for Protocol 2 |

---

### 5.2 OFIA Adjuncts (Supplement Hypnosis - Do NOT Replace)

> **Critical Understanding:**
> - Adjuncts provide **analgesia and sympatholysis**
> - Adjuncts do **NOT** provide surgical hypnosis
> - Adjuncts allow **dose reduction** of propofol/sevoflurane while maintaining depth
> - **Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness**

#### Dexmedetomidine Infusion

**Role:** Sedation, sympatholysis, opioid-sparing analgesia (NOT primary hypnosis)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum | **Higher end (0.7 mcg/kg/hr) may be used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks; NO bolus loading |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Titrate to effect |
| **Stop Time** | 10–15 min before case end | 10–15 min before case end | Prevents prolonged sedation |

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Continuous HR/BP monitoring
- **Stop if HR <50 with symptoms** or **<45 regardless of symptoms**
- **Reduce or stop** if hypotension (MAP <60) unresponsive to fluids/vasopressors

**Bradycardia Management:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **Then:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **Consider:** Discontinuing dexmedetomidine if recurrent

**Contraindications:**
- High-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Severe bradycardia (HR <50 at baseline)
- Severe hypotension (MAP <60 at baseline)

#### Ketamine Infusion (Optional)

**Role:** Analgesia, dissociation, NMDA antagonism (NOT reliable unconsciousness)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr | 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or **omit** | **Higher end (0.25 mg/kg/hr) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Start Time** | After induction | After induction | If bolus given at induction |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | May omit entirely in high-risk |

**BIS Monitoring Caveat:**
- Ketamine **dissociates cortical activity** and may increase BIS
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine
- Correlate with clinical context (movement, autonomic signs, raw EEG trends)

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury

#### Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Protocol 2 Specific Adjunct)

**Role:** Systemic analgesia, anti-inflammatory effects, opioid-sparing

> **Protocol 2 Note:** Lidocaine infusion is more commonly used in Protocol 2 (vs Protocol 1) as an additional systemic adjunct to compensate for lack of regional blocks.

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail/Hepatic Impairment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | **1–1.5 mg/kg/hr** | **1 mg/kg/hr maximum** | Start after induction once hemodynamically stable |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Use infusion pump for accuracy |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | Per institutional protocol |
| **Total Duration** | Typically <2–3 hours | <2 hours preferred | Institutional maximum often 3 hours |

**Contraindications:**
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** - absolute
- **Complete heart block without pacemaker** - absolute
- **Amide local anesthetic allergy** - absolute
- **Severe cardiac conduction disease** - relative (use with caution)

**Monitoring for CNS Toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, agitation, seizures
- **Action:** Stop infusion immediately if any signs/symptoms; prepare for LAST management

**Why Lidocaine Infusion in Protocol 2:**
- Compensates for lack of regional blocks
- Evidence for reduced opioid consumption and improved recovery
- Synergistic with other OFIA adjuncts
- Generally well-tolerated when dosed conservatively

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions do NOT use lidocaine infusions
- Verify local policy and formulary availability
- May require specific credentialing or approval

#### Magnesium Sulfate Maintenance (If Loaded)

**Role:** NMDA antagonism, mild analgesia

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Maintenance Rate** | 8–10 mg/kg/hr if loading dose given |
| **Duration** | Continue until skin closure |
| **Warning** | Potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate prolonged paralysis |

**Monitoring:**
- TOF monitoring essential (see Section 8.3)
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

### 5.3 Hemodynamic Management

> **Goal:** Maintain adequate perfusion while minimizing vasopressor-induced tachycardia and hypertension.

**Target Parameters:**

| Parameter | Target | Individualization |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **MAP** | ≥65 mmHg | Higher target (70–75) for chronic HTN (baseline SBP >160) or CAD/cerebrovascular disease |
| **Heart Rate** | 50–100 bpm | Individualize based on baseline and cardiac status |
| **SpO₂** | ≥95% | ≥92% acceptable in chronic lung disease |

**Hypotension Management:**

| Clinical Scenario | First-Line | Alternative | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **MAP <65, HR adequate** | **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** | Phenylephrine infusion 20–50 mcg/min | Repeat boluses q3–5min PRN |
| **MAP <65, HR <60** | **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** | Ephedrine 5 mg q5min PRN | Mixed alpha/beta agonist |
| **Severe hypotension (MAP <50)** | **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** | Epinephrine infusion | Call for help |
| **Persistent hypotension** | Consider phenylephrine infusion | 20–50 mcg/min titrated | Severe cardiac disease |

**Dexmedetomidine-Related Bradycardia/Hypotension:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **For bradycardia:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **For hypotension:** Phenylephrine or ephedrine as above
4. **If recurrent:** Discontinue dexmedetomidine

**Hypertension Management:**

| Clinical Scenario | Management | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **SBP >180 or MAP >110** | Assess anesthetic depth first | May need more propofol/sevoflurane |
| **Persistent despite adequate depth** | Labetalol 5–10 mg IV or hydralazine 5–10 mg IV | Per institutional protocol |
| **Associated with tachycardia** | Esmolol 10–20 mg IV or labetalol | Beta-blockade preferred |

**Fluid Management:**
- Goal-directed fluid therapy preferred
- Avoid aggressive crystalloid boluses (increases third-spacing)
- Typical total: 500–1000 mL crystalloid for 90-minute case
- Replace blood loss milliliter-for-milliliter with crystalloid 1:1 or colloid as indicated

### 5.4 Key Principle: Zero Intraoperative Opioids

**Protocol 2 is opioid-free intraoperatively.**

**This means:**
- No fentanyl boluses during case
- No hydromorphone during case
- No remifentanil infusion during case
- Analgesia provided by: surgeon periarticular infiltration + OFIA adjuncts + multimodal foundation

**Exception:**
If patient safety requires opioid administration (e.g., severe pain despite adequate anesthetic depth, hemodynamic instability from pain/sympathetic surge), conversion to opioid rescue is appropriate. **This does not constitute pathway failure** - it represents appropriate clinical judgment.

**Document:**
- Reason for opioid administration
- Total opioid dose given
- Patient response
- Plan for PACU monitoring (enhanced if opioid given)

---

## 6. Emergence

> **Emergence is a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning and controlled execution.**

### 6.1 Pre-Emergence Planning (10–15 Minutes Before Anticipated End)

**Goal:** Smooth, controlled emergence without prolonged sedation or delayed extubation.

**Actions:**

| Time Point | Action | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **15 min before end** | Taper or stop dexmedetomidine | Prevent prolonged sedation |
| **15 min before end** | Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing (50–75 mcg/kg/min) | Begin lightening depth |
| **10 min before end** | Plan ketamine discontinuation (if used) | Minimize dissociative effects |
| **10 min before end** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if used) | Per institutional protocol |
| **10 min before end** | Verify TOF monitor functioning and ready | Essential for reversal timing |
| **At skin closure** | Stop ketamine infusion | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop dexmedetomidine (if not already) | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if not already) | — |

**Communication:**
- Inform surgical team of anticipated emergence timing
- Confirm no additional procedures planned
- Verify dressing application plan

### 6.2 Hypnotic Reduction

**Propofol TIVA:**
- Taper to 25–50 mcg/kg/min at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Sevoflurane:**
- Reduce to 0.4–0.6 MAC at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Do NOT:**
- Abruptly stop hypnotic before patient ready to emerge
- Rely on adjuncts alone (dexmedetomidine is NOT sufficient for unconsciousness)

### 6.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

#### Ondansetron

**Timing:** Before emergence or at skin closure

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **All patients** | **4 mg IV** | If not already given preoperatively |
| **High PONV risk** | 4 mg IV (in addition to scopolamine patch) | May repeat 4 mg in PACU if needed |

#### Neuromuscular Reversal

> **Critical:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 is **MANDATORY** before extubation. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a patient safety risk.

**Sugammadex Dosing:**

| TOF Status | Dose | Wait Time | Expected Outcome |
|------------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **TOF count ≥2, ratio <0.9** | **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF ratio ≥0.9 |
| **Deep block (TOF 1–2)** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF count ≥2, then reassess |
| **Post-tetanic count only** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | May require additional time |

**After sugammadex administration:**
1. Wait 2–3 minutes
2. Reassess TOF ratio
3. **Confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9** before proceeding to extubation
4. If TOF <0.9 → wait longer or consider additional sugammadex (consult attending)

**Special Considerations:**
- **Magnesium potentiates NMB:** May need higher sugammadex dose or longer wait time
- **Obesity:** Dose sugammadex to **total body weight** (not IBW)
- **Renal impairment:** Sugammadex elimination prolonged; monitor closely

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met before extubation:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Target |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Consciousness** | Patient opens eyes to command, squeezes hand | Awake and follows commands |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Count breaths over 15 seconds | 10–20 breaths/min |
| **Tidal Volume** | Observe chest rise or measure with spirometry | ≥5 mL/kg (≥350 mL for 70 kg) |
| **Oxygenation** | Pulse oximetry | SpO₂ ≥95% on 100% O₂ (≥92% if chronic lung disease) |
| **Neuromuscular Function** | TOF monitoring | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 (mandatory)** |
| **Hemodynamics** | Continuous monitoring | MAP ≥65 mmHg or near baseline |
| **No Active Bleeding** | Surgical team confirmation | No ongoing hemorrhage or concern |

**Additional Clinical Assessment:**
- Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
- Sustained grip strength bilaterally
- Sustained tongue protrusion
- No fasciculations
- Adequate cough and gag reflex

**Do NOT Extubate If:**
- Any somnolence remains
- TOF <0.9
- Inadequate respiratory effort (RR <10, TV <5 mL/kg)
- Hemodynamic instability
- Active bleeding or surgical concern
- Patient confused or combative

**Special Populations:**

| Population | Additional Considerations |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Elderly (>75)** | Lower threshold to delay extubation; ensure fully awake |
| **Frail** | Extended observation before extubation decision |
| **OSA** | More stringent criteria; ensure robust ventilation |
| **Cardiac Disease** | Ensure hemodynamic stability before airway manipulation |

### 6.5 Post-Extubation Care

**Immediate post-extubation:**
- Apply supplemental O₂ (nasal cannula 2–4 L/min or simple face mask 6–8 L/min)
- Continue standard ASA monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP, RR)
- Position patient semi-upright (30–45 degrees if not contraindicated)
- Suction oropharynx PRN (avoid deep suctioning)

**Assessment:**
- Pain level (numeric rating scale 0–10) - **expect higher pain than Protocol 1**
- Nausea/vomiting
- Orientation and mental status
- Motor function (leg/knee movement)
- Sensation (expect less numbness than Protocol 1)

**Communication to PACU:**
See Section 7.6 (Handoff to PACU)

---

## 7. Postoperative Pain Management

> **Expected pain profile WITHOUT regional blocks: NRS 2–5 in first 12 hours.**

### 7.1 Expected Pain Profile

**Without ACB + IPACK blocks (surgeon infiltration only):**

| Time Period | Expected NRS | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0–4 hours** | 2–4 | Good analgesia from surgeon infiltration + systemic multimodal |
| **4–8 hours** | 3–5 | Surgeon infiltration beginning to wear off; more rescue needs |
| **8–12 hours** | 4–6 | Surgeon infiltration worn off; oral multimodal primary |
| **12–24 hours** | 3–5 | Oral multimodal regimen + rescue PRN |

**If NRS ≥7 at any time:**
- Assess adequacy of surgeon infiltration (verify performed and documented)
- Consider tourniquet pain contribution (resolves quickly)
- Evaluate for surgical complications (hematoma, compartment syndrome, fracture)
- Implement aggressive multimodal rescue (see Section 7.3)
- Lower threshold to use opioid rescue in Protocol 2 vs Protocol 1

### 7.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia (Foundation for All Patients)

**Start immediately in PACU and continue on floor:**

| Medication | Dose | Route | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg | PO/IV | Every 6 hours | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment)<br>4 g/day (normal liver) | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg | PO | Every 12 hours | 400 mg/day | **First-line NSAID** (selective COX-2)<br>**Avoid:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent CV event |
| **Ketorolac** (alternative) | 15 mg | IV | Every 6 hours | 60 mg/day; max 5 days | **Use with caution:** Age >65, CrCl <50, bleeding risk<br>Consider avoiding in elderly |
| **Meloxicam** (alternative) | 7.5–15 mg | PO | Once daily | 15 mg/day | Alternative NSAID if celecoxib not available |

**NSAID Decision-Making:**
- **Critical in Protocol 2:** NSAIDs reduce opioid requirement by 30–50% when blocks absent
- **High caution required in:**
  - Elderly (>75 years)
  - Renal impairment (CrCl <50)
  - Cardiovascular disease (recent MI/stroke, heart failure)
  - Concurrent anticoagulation (bleeding risk)
  - Gastrointestinal disease (ulcer, bleeding history)
- **Prefer selective COX-2 (celecoxib)** over ketorolac in higher-risk patients
- **Duration:** Limit to 5 days maximum; reassess daily

### 7.3 Rescue Analgesia (Conservative Stepwise Approach)

> **Protocol 2 anticipates HIGHER rescue needs than Protocol 1. Use multimodal rescue but have lower threshold for opioids.**

#### Step 1: Reassess and Optimize

**Before administering rescue medications:**
- [ ] Verify scheduled multimodal medications given on time
- [ ] Confirm surgeon performed periarticular infiltration (check documentation)
- [ ] Reposition patient for comfort
- [ ] Apply ice to surgical site (if not contraindicated)
- [ ] Assess for surgical complications (see Section 9.2)

#### Step 2: Ketamine Rescue (If Institutional Protocol Allows)

**Indication:** Moderate to severe pain (NRS 5–7) unresponsive to multimodal foundation

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Maximum |
|-------------------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard adult** | **10–20 mg IV** (0.1–0.15 mg/kg) | Slow push over 1–2 minutes | ~3 doses per reassessment period |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **7–10 mg IV** (0.1 mg/kg) | Slow push over 2 minutes | 2 doses maximum |
| **Frail** | **7–10 mg IV** or **omit** | Slow push over 2 minutes | Consider opioid alternative |

**Reassessment Interval:** 10–15 minutes after each dose

**Reduce Dose or Omit When:**
- Elderly, frail, or hemodynamically unstable
- Tachyarrhythmia-prone patients
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Blood pressure every 5 minutes for first 15 minutes after dose
- Assess for dissociative effects (patients may appear "zoned out" - reassure)

**Institutional Variability:**
- Ketamine as PACU rescue is **not universally adopted**
- Verify local policy before implementation
- Some institutions prefer opioid rescue as first-line

#### Step 3: Opioid Rescue (If Ketamine Inadequate or Contraindicated)

**Indication:** Severe pain (NRS ≥6) unresponsive to multimodal + ketamine, or ketamine contraindicated

> **Protocol 2 Note:** Lower threshold to use opioids than Protocol 1 due to lack of regional blocks. This is EXPECTED and appropriate.

| Patient Population | First Dose | Reassessment Interval | Subsequent Doses |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Standard adult (opioid-naïve)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **Frail** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV; consider longer intervals |
| **Chronic opioid use** | **Hydromorphone 0.4–0.8 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | Titrate to effect; anticipate tolerance |

**Enhanced Monitoring Requirements:**
- **Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry** until stable and pain controlled
- **Consider capnography** for OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve, or high cumulative opioid dose
- **Sedation assessment** every 10–15 minutes using standardized scale (RASS, Pasero)
- **Respiratory rate** every 10–15 minutes; alert if <10 breaths/min

**Naloxone Availability:**
- **Immediately available** at bedside (0.4 mg ampules)
- Dosing if respiratory depression: **0.04–0.08 mg IV** titrated (avoid full reversal/withdrawal)
- May repeat every 2–3 minutes until respiratory rate ≥10 and adequate TV

**Escalation Criteria:**
- If NRS remains ≥6 despite maximal multimodal + ketamine + opioids → **Consult attending anesthesiologist**
- Consider alternative strategies:
  - Rescue regional anesthesia (ACB/IPACK if now feasible)
  - Continuous peripheral nerve block (catheter technique)
  - Epidural analgesia (rare for TKA)
  - Regional anesthesia consultation
  - Pain medicine consultation
- **Evaluate for surgical complications** (see Section 9.2)

### 7.4 Surgeon Periarticular Infiltration Documentation

**Verify surgeon documented:**
- Drug(s) used (typically ropivacaine)
- Concentration (typically 0.2%)
- Volume (typically 100–150 mL)
- Total dose (typically 200–300 mg)
- Any additives (epinephrine, morphine, ketorolac per institutional practice)

**If surgeon infiltration NOT documented:**
- Contact surgeon immediately to document
- Consider this in pain management strategy (may explain high pain scores)
- Lower threshold for rescue analgesia

### 7.5 Mobilization and Physical Therapy

**Goal:** POD 0 ambulation within 4–8 hours post-op (slightly later than Protocol 1)

**Mobilization Protocol:**
- **Phase 1 (2–4 hours):** Sit at edge of bed with assistance
- **Phase 2 (4–8 hours):** Stand with walker and PT assistance
- **Phase 3 (8–12 hours):** Ambulate 10–20 feet with walker
- **Progression:** As tolerated per PT assessment and pain control

**Barriers to Early Mobilization in Protocol 2:**
- **Higher pain scores** (most common barrier)
- Excessive sedation (from adjuncts or rescue opioids)
- PONV
- Hypotension or dizziness
- Patient anxiety about pain with movement

**Strategies to Facilitate Mobilization:**
- Preemptive analgesia before PT (scheduled meds + rescue if needed)
- Reassure patient that movement is safe and beneficial
- Use walker and assistive devices
- PT encouragement and education

### 7.6 Handoff to PACU

> **Standardized handoff is critical for patient safety and continuity of care.**

## 8. Safety Monitoring

### 8.1 Intraoperative Monitoring (Standard ASA)

**Required for all patients:**
- Continuous ECG (5-lead preferred)
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Continuous capnography (from intubation to extubation)
- Blood pressure every 3–5 minutes (non-invasive) or continuous arterial line
- Temperature monitoring (core or near-core)
- Inspired and expired gas analysis (O₂, volatile agent, CO₂)
- Airway pressures and volumes

**Additional considerations:**
- **Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy):** Consider in elderly (>75) or frail patients to avoid excessive anesthetic depth
- **Arterial line:** Severe cardiac disease, anticipated hemodynamic lability, need for frequent blood gas analysis
- **Central venous access:** Not routine for TKA; consider if severe cardiac disease or anticipated large blood loss

### 8.2 Lidocaine Infusion Monitoring (If Used)

**Monitor for CNS toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, agitation
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, seizures
- Late: Cardiovascular collapse (rare at infusion doses)

**Action if signs/symptoms:**
1. **Stop lidocaine infusion immediately**
2. **Call for help** (announce "Possible lidocaine toxicity")
3. **Airway management:** 100% O₂, support ventilation
4. **Seizure control:** Benzodiazepines (midazolam 2–5 mg IV)
5. **If cardiovascular instability:** 20% lipid emulsion therapy (1.5 mL/kg bolus, then 0.25 mL/kg/min infusion)

**20% lipid emulsion immediately available:**
- Must be in OR and PACU
- LAST protocol posted
- Team trained

### 8.3 Neuromuscular Monitoring (Train-of-Four)

> **TOF monitoring is MANDATORY for all patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.**

**Equipment:**
- Quantitative TOF monitor preferred (measures and displays TOF ratio)
- Qualitative assessment (tactile/visual) acceptable if quantitative unavailable
- Typically applied to ulnar nerve (adductor pollicis response)

**Monitoring Points:**
- After rocuronium administration (confirm adequate blockade for intubation)
- Throughout case (if additional NMB doses given)
- Before sugammadex administration (determine dose)
- **After sugammadex administration (confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9)**
- **Before extubation (verify TOF ratio ≥0.9)**

**Magnesium Caveat:**
- Magnesium **potentiates neuromuscular blockade**
- Anticipate **longer duration of paralysis**
- May require **higher sugammadex dose**
- **More frequent TOF assessments** recommended

**TOF Ratio Interpretation:**
- TOF ratio <0.4: Deep blockade
- TOF ratio 0.4–0.7: Moderate blockade
- TOF ratio 0.7–0.9: Mild residual blockade (clinical weakness possible)
- **TOF ratio ≥0.9: Adequate recovery (safe for extubation)**

**DO NOT EXTUBATE if TOF <0.9** unless exceptional circumstances and senior attending approval.

### 8.4 PACU Monitoring

**Standard PACU monitoring (all Protocol 2 patients):**
- Continuous pulse oximetry (minimum 1–2 hours, longer if sedation or opioid rescue)
- Blood pressure every 15 minutes initially, then every 30 minutes when stable
- Respiratory rate every 15 minutes
- Pain assessment (NRS) every 15–30 minutes
- Sedation assessment every 15 minutes initially
- Nausea/vomiting assessment
- Surgical site assessment (dressing, drains, neurovascular status)

**Enhanced monitoring for high-risk subgroups:**

| Risk Factor | Additional Monitoring |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | Consider capnography; continuous pulse oximetry until fully awake and stable; **EXPECT higher opioid rescue needs** |
| **Elderly (>75) or frail** | More frequent respiratory and sedation assessments (every 10 min initially) |
| **Significant opioid rescue given** | Enhanced respiratory monitoring; continuous pulse oximetry; consider capnography |
| **High cumulative opioid in PACU** | Continuous pulse oximetry; capnography strongly recommended; frequent sedation scores |

**Naloxone preparedness:**
- Immediately available at bedside for any patient receiving opioids
- Dosing: 0.04–0.08 mg IV titrated (avoid full reversal)

**LAST preparedness:**
- 20% lipid emulsion immediately available in PACU
- LAST protocol posted and staff trained
- Monitor for late LAST signs (can occur hours after surgeon infiltration)

### 8.5 Floor Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**Standard for all patients:**
- Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, temp) every 4 hours
- Pain assessment with each vital sign check
- Sedation assessment with each vital sign check
- Neurovascular checks (distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, motor) every 4 hours

**Enhanced monitoring (high-risk patients):**
- OSA: Consider continuous pulse oximetry overnight per institutional protocol
- Significant opioid consumption in PACU: More frequent assessments (every 2 hours)
- Frail/elderly with opioid exposure: Lower threshold for monitored bed (step-down unit)

## 9. Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Inadequate Analgesia (High Pain Scores Expected in Protocol 2)

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Cause | Assessment | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Surgeon infiltration inadequate/not performed** | Review documentation; confirm surgeon performed infiltration | Aggressive multimodal + opioid rescue; consider rescue regional block |
| **Surgeon infiltration worn off early** | Timing (typically 6–12 hours); expected in Protocol 2 | Transition to oral multimodal + opioid PRN; this is NORMAL for Protocol 2 |
| **Tourniquet pain** | Timing (during inflation); resolves quickly post-deflation | Usually self-limited; opioid if severe |
| **Surgical complication** | Increasing pain over time; tense compartment; neurovascular changes | **Emergency surgical consult** |

**Management Algorithm:**
1. **Verify surgeon infiltration performed** (check documentation)
2. **Optimize multimodal:** Ensure scheduled meds given on time
3. **Ketamine rescue:** 10–20 mg IV if institutional protocol allows
4. **Opioid rescue:** Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV titrated (LOWER threshold than Protocol 1)
5. **If refractory:** Consider rescue regional block (ACB/IPACK if now feasible) or consult attending

### 9.2 Concern for Surgical Complication

**Red flags requiring immediate evaluation:**

| Finding | Concern | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Increasing pain over time** | Hematoma, compartment syndrome | Surgical consult; remove dressing to assess |
| **Tense, swollen compartment** | Compartment syndrome | **Emergency surgical consult**; measure compartment pressures |
| **Absent distal pulses** | Vascular injury | **Emergency vascular surgery consult** |
| **New motor deficit** | Nerve injury, compartment syndrome | Surgical consult; document neuro exam |
| **Severe pain with passive stretch** | Compartment syndrome | **Emergency surgical consult** |
| **Numbness/paresthesias** | Nerve injury | Surgical consult; document distribution |

**Do NOT attribute severe, progressive pain to "lack of blocks" without ruling out surgical complications.**

### 9.3 Dexmedetomidine-Related Bradycardia

**Management Algorithm:**

| Heart Rate | Symptoms | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **HR 50–55** | Asymptomatic | Reduce dexmedetomidine by 50%; monitor closely |
| **HR 50–55** | Symptomatic (dizziness, chest pain) | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **HR 45–50** | Any | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **HR <45** | Any | Stop dexmedetomidine; glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg IV; consider atropine if severe |

**If recurrent despite management:** Discontinue dexmedetomidine for remainder of case.

**Document:**
- Bradycardia event and management
- Dexmedetomidine total dose and duration
- Patient response to intervention

### 9.4 Ketamine-Related Issues

**Dissociative Emergence ("Emergence Delirium"):**

| Presentation | Management |
|--------------|------------|
| Agitation, confusion, hallucinations | Calm, quiet environment; minimize stimulation; reorient frequently |
| Severe agitation | Midazolam 1–2 mg IV (caution in elderly) |
| Prolonged (>30 min) | Consider low-dose propofol (10–20 mg IV) or dexmedetomidine |

**Hypertension/Tachycardia:**
- If severe (SBP >180): Consider labetalol 5–10 mg IV or esmolol 10–20 mg IV
- Usually transient; resolves with ketamine cessation

**Nystagmus, Diplopia:**
- Reassure patient these are expected effects and will resolve
- Usually benign and self-limited

### 9.5 Lidocaine Infusion Toxicity

**Early Recognition:**

| Sign/Symptom | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus | **Stop infusion immediately**; monitor closely |
| Dizziness, agitation, confusion | **Stop infusion immediately**; prepare for seizure management |
| Seizure | **Stop infusion**; benzodiazepines; 20% lipid emulsion ready |
| Cardiovascular instability | **Stop infusion**; lipid emulsion therapy; ACLS |

**Prevention:**
- Use conservative doses (1–1.5 mg/kg/hr)
- Reduce in elderly, hepatic impairment
- Monitor for early signs
- Limit duration (<3 hours)

### 9.6 Hypotension Refractory to Vasopressors

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Cause | Assessment | Management |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Hypovolemia** | Low UOP, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure | Fluid bolus 250–500 mL crystalloid |
| **Excessive anesthetic depth** | BIS <40, low ETCO₂ | Reduce propofol/sevoflurane |
| **Dexmedetomidine effect** | Recent loading or high infusion rate | Stop dexmedetomidine |
| **Hemorrhage** | Increasing drain output, tachycardia, falling Hgb | Surgical assessment; transfusion if indicated |
| **Cardiac (rare)** | ECG changes, elevated troponin | Cardiology consult; consider ICU |

**Escalation:**
- If MAP <60 despite phenylephrine infusion → Consider epinephrine infusion (0.01–0.05 mcg/kg/min)
- If concern for cardiac etiology → Arterial line, consider TEE or TTE

### 9.7 Prolonged Neuromuscular Blockade

**Causes:**
- Magnesium administration (common in Protocol 2 if used)
- Renal impairment
- Hypothermia
- Electrolyte abnormalities (hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia)
- Drug interactions

**Management:**
1. **Verify sugammadex dose adequate:** May need additional dose (consult attending)
2. **Check TOF ratio repeatedly:** May take longer than expected
3. **Assess temperature:** Warm patient if hypothermic (<36°C)
4. **Consider labs:** Magnesium, calcium, potassium if prolonged
5. **If persistent:** Maintain ventilatory support, consider ICU transfer

**Do NOT extubate** until TOF ratio ≥0.9 achieved.

---

## 10. Clinical Pearls

### Protocol Selection Pearls

1. **Protocol 2 is first-line when blocks contraindicated:** If anticoagulation timing doesn't allow blocks, use Protocol 2 (not Protocol 3). Reserve Protocol 3 for when OFIA adjuncts are inappropriate.

2. **Surgeon infiltration is NOT optional in Protocol 2:** This is the ONLY regional analgesia component. Verify it will be performed before starting case.

3. **Set realistic pain expectations:** Protocol 2 patients will have HIGHER pain (NRS 2–5) than Protocol 1 (NRS 0–3). This is EXPECTED and should be communicated preoperatively.

4. **Lower threshold for opioid rescue:** Don't be a hero trying to avoid opioids entirely in Protocol 2. Use them when needed—still far less than Protocol 3.

5. **Protocol 2 still achieves opioid-sparing goals:** Zero intraoperative opioids + reduced PACU opioids compared to conventional approach = success.

### Adjunct Utilization Pearls

6. **Consider higher-end adjunct dosing in Protocol 2:** Without blocks, you may need dexmedetomidine 0.7 mcg/kg/hr and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg/hr (vs lower doses in Protocol 1).

7. **Lidocaine infusion is your friend:** When safe to use (no severe hepatic impairment), lidocaine 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr provides meaningful systemic analgesia.

8. **Monitor lidocaine closely:** Early signs (perioral numbness, tinnitus) → stop immediately. Don't wait for seizures.

9. **Magnesium still useful but not critical:** Unlike Protocol 1 where you layer multiple adjuncts, in Protocol 2 consider prioritizing dexmedetomidine + ketamine + lidocaine over magnesium.

10. **Adjunct stacking matters:** Dexmed + ketamine + lidocaine is synergistic. Don't just pick one—use multiple when appropriate.

### Induction and Maintenance Pearls

11. **Same hypnotic principles as Protocol 1:** Propofol/sevoflurane maintain unconsciousness. Adjuncts do NOT replace hypnosis. This is universal.

12. **Propofol TIVA preferred in Protocol 2:** Better antiemetic profile, precise control, synergy with OFIA adjuncts.

13. **Consider ketamine bolus at induction:** Without blocks, ketamine 0.3–0.5 mg/kg IV at induction helps bridge to surgeon infiltration.

### PACU Management Pearls

14. **Anticipate higher rescue needs:** Protocol 2 patients typically need 2–3x more PACU opioid rescue than Protocol 1. This is NORMAL.

15. **Don't delay opioid rescue:** If NRS ≥6 despite multimodal + ketamine, give hydromorphone. Undertreating pain delays mobilization and recovery.

16. **Surgeon infiltration wears off faster:** Expect pain increase at 6–12 hours vs 12–18 hours for ACB/IPACK. Preemptive oral analgesia.

17. **OSA patients still do well with Protocol 2:** Opioid-sparing maintained even without blocks. Still preferable to Protocol 3.

### Communication Pearls

18. **Document why blocks omitted:** Critical for continuity of care. PACU/floor staff need to know blocks weren't performed.

19. **Set preop expectations:** Tell patient: "You'll have more pain than if we did nerve blocks, but we'll manage it aggressively."

20. **Confirm surgeon infiltration plan:** Pre-case discussion ensures surgeon knows their infiltration is critical to the anesthetic plan.

### Safety Pearls

21. **LAST can still occur:** Surgeon infiltration uses high doses (200–300 mg ropivacaine). Lipid emulsion must be available.

22. **Lidocaine infusion adds to LA burden:** Total systemic lidocaine = infusion + surgeon infiltration. Track cumulative exposure.

23. **Multiple adjuncts = multiple side effects:** Dex + ketamine + lidocaine all have unique risks. Know how to manage each.

### Recovery Pearls

24. **Mobilization slightly delayed vs Protocol 1:** Target 4–8 hours (vs 4–6 hours). Pain management is rate-limiting step.

25. **Block-free doesn't mean bad outcomes:** Protocol 2 still achieves ERAS goals, reduced PONV, earlier discharge than conventional approach.

## Appendix B: Patient Information Sheet

### What is Protocol 2 (OFIA Without Nerve Blocks)?

**For patients and families:**

Protocol 2 is an anesthesia approach designed to minimize opioid use while providing good pain control for your knee replacement surgery, WITHOUT using nerve blocks.

**Why no nerve blocks?**
- Your blood-thinning medication timing doesn't allow us to safely perform nerve blocks
- Or you declined nerve blocks after discussion
- Or your anatomy makes nerve blocks difficult/unsafe

**Before Surgery:**
- You'll receive oral pain medications (acetaminophen and an anti-inflammatory)
- No nerve block injections will be placed

**During Surgery:**
- You'll be completely asleep and won't feel anything
- We use medications for sleep and pain control that are NOT opioids
- Your surgeon will inject numbing medicine directly into the knee during surgery
- We may use an IV numbing medicine infusion (lidocaine) for additional pain control

**After Surgery:**
- You'll have MORE pain than if we did nerve blocks (typically 3–5 out of 10)
- You'll receive regular non-opioid pain medications (pills and IV)
- If you need additional pain relief, we have other options including short-acting pain medicines
- You may need SOME opioid pain medication (but much less than traditional approaches)
- Most patients can sit up and walk with assistance on the same day as surgery

**Benefits:**
- Good pain control without heavy opioid use (though more than nerve block approach)
- Less nausea and drowsiness than traditional opioid-heavy anesthetics
- Faster recovery than conventional approaches
- Safe when nerve blocks are not possible

**What to Expect:**
- More pain than nerve block approach in first 24 hours
- May need pain medication more frequently
- Still able to participate in physical therapy same day

**Questions?**
Ask your anesthesiologist or surgeon for more information.

## Appendix C: Protocol 2 vs Protocol 1 Comparison

**When to choose Protocol 2 over Protocol 1:**

| Factor | Protocol 1 | Protocol 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Regional blocks feasible?** | Yes | No (contraindicated or refused) |
| **Anticoagulation timing** | Meets ASRA requirements | Outside ASRA windows |
| **Patient preference** | Accepts blocks | Refuses blocks |
| **Expected pain (0–12h)** | NRS 0–3 | NRS 2–5 |
| **PACU opioid rescue needs** | Minimal | Moderate |
| **Time to mobilization** | 4–6 hours | 4–8 hours |
| **Workflow efficiency** | Longer (block placement) | Faster (no blocks) |
| **LAST risk** | Present (blocks) | Present (surgeon infiltration) |

**Bottom line:** Both protocols are opioid-sparing and ERAS-aligned. Protocol 1 is preferred when blocks are safe and feasible. Protocol 2 is the appropriate OFIA choice when blocks are not an option.

## End of Protocol 2

**Remember:** This protocol is an educational framework. Patient safety requires qualified practitioners, appropriate resources, institutional oversight, and commitment to continuous quality improvement.

**When in doubt, consult senior colleagues, review primary literature, and prioritize conservative approaches that minimize risk while optimizing outcomes.**

**Protocol 2 maintains opioid-sparing principles even without regional blocks—it's a valid and effective ERAS-aligned approach when blocks are not feasible.**

## 1. Purpose and Clinical Context

### 1.1 Protocol Objectives

This protocol provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway WITHOUT regional nerve blocks** for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) that:

- **Maintains opioid-free intraoperative strategy** despite absence of regional blocks
- **Relies on systemic multimodal adjuncts** (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine infusion, magnesium)
- **Utilizes surgeon periarticular infiltration** as primary regional analgesia component
- **Reduces PONV** through opioid-sparing and propofol-based strategies
- **Supports ERAS goals** including early mobilization (POD 0 within 4–8 hours)
- **Provides alternative when blocks contraindicated** or refused

### 1.2 Evidence Base

This protocol is informed by:
- ERAS Society Guidelines for Hip and Knee Arthroplasty (2019, 2024 updates)
- ASA/APSF perioperative safety communications (2024)
- SAMBA Consensus Statement on Opioid-Free Anesthesia (2020)
- Current peer-reviewed literature on systemic multimodal analgesia and lidocaine infusions

**Complete evidence grading and citations:** See `../../07_References_Evidence_2024.md`

### 1.3 When to Use This Protocol

**Default Pathway:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (blocks contraindicated) → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Patient refuses regional blocks after informed consent → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Body habitus prevents adequate ultrasound visualization for blocks
- Severe peripheral neuropathy affecting surgical extremity
- Prior surgery distorting anatomy (difficult block placement)
- Workflow constraints (time, equipment, personnel availability)
- Attending/institutional preference for block-free OFIA approach

**Position in Algorithm:**
- When blocks feasible and safe → **Protocol 1** (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) preferred
- When blocks NOT feasible but OFIA appropriate → **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free) preferred over Protocol 3
- When OFIA adjuncts contraindicated → **Protocol 3** (opioid-inclusive)

### 1.4 Key Difference from Protocol 1

**Protocol 2 vs Protocol 1:**
- **No ACB/IPACK blocks** → Higher expected pain (NRS 2–5 vs 0–3)
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration** is CRITICAL component
- **May include lidocaine infusion** as additional systemic adjunct
- **Faster workflow** (no block placement time)
- **More PACU rescue needs** anticipated and planned for
- **Still opioid-sparing** - zero intraoperative opioids

---

## 2. Patient Selection Criteria

### 2.1 Ideal Candidates

**Strongly preferred for:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (most common indication)
- Patient refusal of regional blocks despite counseling
- High PONV risk (OFIA + propofol strategy still beneficial)
- OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3) - opioid-sparing still critical even without blocks
- Age >75 years when opioid minimization advantageous
- Body habitus preventing adequate block placement
- Prior surgery distorting regional anatomy

### 2.2 When Protocol 2 is CONTRAINDICATED (Use Protocol 3 Instead)

**Consider Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive) when:**
- **Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated:**
  - Active psychosis (ketamine contraindicated)
  - High-grade AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine contraindicated)
  - Severe hepatic impairment (lidocaine contraindicated)
  - CrCl <30 mL/min (magnesium contraindicated)
- **Hemodynamic instability** where adjuncts may worsen status
- **Severe cardiac disease** where dexmedetomidine/ketamine poorly tolerated
- **Attending judgment** that opioid-based approach safer for specific patient

**OFIA adjunct contraindications summary:**

| Adjunct | Absolute Contraindications | Relative Contraindications |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ketamine** | Active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN (SBP >180); acute globe injury | Frailty; hemodynamic instability; catecholamine-depleted physiology; age >85 |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-grade AV block without pacemaker; severe baseline bradycardia (HR <50) | Age >75; severe cardiac disease; baseline hypotension |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Severe hepatic impairment; complete heart block; amide LA allergy; severe cardiac conduction disease | Hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B/C); seizure history |
| **Magnesium** | CrCl <30 mL/min; myasthenia gravis; complete heart block | Renal impairment (CrCl 30-50); risk of prolonged NMB |

### 2.3 Special Populations

**Elderly (>75 years):**
- Reduce all medication doses by 25–40%
- Midazolam: 0.5 mg maximum
- Propofol induction: 1–1.5 mg/kg
- Dexmedetomidine: 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum
- Ketamine: 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or omit
- Lidocaine: 1 mg/kg/hr maximum
- Enhanced emergence and PACU monitoring

**Frail patients:**
- Similar reductions as elderly
- Lower threshold to omit ketamine and lidocaine infusion
- Prioritize propofol TIVA over sevoflurane (better control)
- Extended PACU observation
- Lower threshold for monitored bed postoperatively

**OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3):**
- Protocol 2 is **appropriate** (opioid-sparing maintained)
- **BUT:** Anticipate higher rescue opioid needs in PACU than Protocol 1
- Ensure continuous pulse oximetry in PACU/floor
- Consider capnography in PACU
- Lower threshold for monitored bed

**Severe cardiac disease:**
- Careful hemodynamic management essential
- Phenylephrine infusion may be needed
- Consider arterial line
- Dexmedetomidine use with extreme caution (risk of bradycardia/hypotension)
- Lower threshold to omit dexmedetomidine and use opioid-based approach (Protocol 3)

**Chronic opioid use:**
- Protocol 2 still appropriate (continue home regimen)
- Anticipate **significantly higher** PACU rescue needs than Protocol 1
- May need Protocol 3 if very high tolerance (>120 MME/day) or if analgesia inadequate

---

## 3. Preoperative Phase

### 3.1 Preanesthetic Assessment

**Standard evaluation:**
- Complete history and physical examination
- Airway assessment (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck mobility)
- Review prior anesthesia records (complications, PONV, difficult airway, delirium)
- ASA physical status classification
- NPO status verification

**Risk factor identification:**
- **OSA:** STOP-Bang score
- **PONV risk:** Apfel score (female, non-smoker, hx PONV/motion sickness, postop opioids)
- **Frailty:** Clinical Frailty Scale or simple assessment (gait speed, grip strength)
- **Cognitive impairment:** Baseline mental status, prior delirium
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Functional capacity, recent stress testing, medication reconciliation
- **Renal function:** Creatinine clearance calculation (Cockcroft-Gault)
- **Hepatic function:** LFTs, synthetic function (important for lidocaine infusion safety)

**Chronic medication reconciliation:**
- **Opioids:** Document baseline regimen; continue morning dose
- **Anticoagulation:** Document why blocks not performed (see Section 3.2)
- **Cardiovascular medications:** Continue beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors (hold ARBs per institutional policy)
- **Psychiatric medications:** Continue SSRIs, antipsychotics; note ketamine interactions

### 3.2 Documentation of Block Omission

**Critical documentation requirement:**
In preoperative note, **explicitly document reason blocks NOT performed:**

| Reason | Documentation Example |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Anticoagulation timing** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, last dose 48 hours ago (ASRA requires ≥72h for deep peripheral blocks). Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Patient refusal** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient declined regional blocks after discussion of risks/benefits. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Anatomy/body habitus** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: BMI 52, unable to obtain adequate ultrasound visualization. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Prior surgery** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Prior femoral vascular surgery distorting anatomy. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Workflow constraints** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Time constraints and OR availability. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) per attending decision." |

### 3.3 Surgeon Coordination for Periarticular Infiltration

> **CRITICAL:** Surgeon periarticular infiltration is the ONLY regional analgesia component in Protocol 2. This MUST be performed for adequate pain control.

**Pre-case discussion with surgeon:**
- [ ] Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular local anesthetic infiltration (LIA)
- [ ] Verify typical volume and concentration (e.g., 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2%)
- [ ] Ensure surgeon will document: drug(s), concentration(s), volume(s), total dose (mg)
- [ ] Plan for cumulative local anesthetic dose tracking

**Typical surgeon periarticular infiltration:**
- **Ropivacaine 0.2%, 100–150 mL** injected into posterior capsule, medial/lateral soft tissues, periosteum
- **Total ropivacaine dose:** 200–300 mg (higher than Protocol 1 blocks, still below toxic threshold)
- **Expected duration:** 6–12 hours (shorter than ACB/IPACK)

### 3.4 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed Multimodal Foundation)

| Medication | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | PO | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | **Contraindications:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke, aspirin allergy<br>Alternative: Meloxicam 15 mg PO |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8–10 mg | IV | After IV access obtained; reduce to 4–6 mg if diabetic (monitor glucose) |

**Additional preoperative considerations:**

| Medication | Indication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Scopolamine patch** | High PONV risk only (Apfel ≥3) | 1.5 mg transdermal | Apply evening prior or ≥4 hours preop<br>**Contraindicated:** Narrow-angle glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | Anxiolysis if needed | 0.5–2 mg IV | Reduce to 0.5 mg or avoid in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | **NOT recommended** | — | Risk of sedation, delirium, respiratory depression outweighs benefit |
| **Home opioids** | Chronic opioid use | Baseline dose | Continue morning dose; do not escalate preoperatively |

**Documentation:**
- All preoperative medications given with timing
- Any medications held and rationale
- Allergies and adverse drug reactions verified

---

## 4. Induction

> **Induction achieves rapid, reliable loss of consciousness using propofol bolus.** Adjuncts are used to blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, NOT to replace hypnosis.
> Processed EEG indices must be interpreted in clinical context and **must not be used as the sole determinant of anesthetic depth**, particularly when ketamine, hypothermia, or neuromodulatory adjuncts are present.

### 4.1 Pre-Induction Checklist

**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Patient correctly identified, procedure verified (Time Out)
- [ ] ASA standard monitors applied and functioning
- [ ] IV access confirmed patent (consider 2nd IV for infusions)
- [ ] Airway equipment prepared and checked
- [ ] Anesthesia machine checkout complete
- [ ] Suction functioning
- [ ] Vasoactive medications drawn and labeled (phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine)
- [ ] Intubation equipment ready (video laryngoscope preferred)
- [ ] Difficult airway cart available
- [ ] Team briefing complete
- [ ] **Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular infiltration**

### 4.2 Induction Medications

**Primary Induction: Propofol**

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Expected Effect |
|-------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard adult** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 30–60 seconds | LOC in 30–45 seconds |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Frail** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 90–120 seconds | LOC in 60–90 seconds; anticipate hypotension |
| **Hypovolemia suspected** | **1–1.2 mg/kg IV** | Very slow push | Aggressive vasopressor readiness |

**Critical Safety:**
- **Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension**
- **Ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue:**
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (if HR adequate)
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** (if HR <60)
  - **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** (if severe hypotension)
- Have vasopressor drawn and ready BEFORE injecting propofol
- Anticipate hypotension in elderly, frail, severe cardiac disease, hypovolemia

#### Optional: Midazolam

**Only if needed for additional anxiolysis:**

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 0–1 mg IV | Often omitted if already dosed preoperatively |
| **Elderly (>75)** | 0–0.5 mg IV | **Avoid if possible**; high delirium risk |
| **Frail/OSA** | **Avoid** | Respiratory depression risk |

**Decision point:** If midazolam 1–2 mg already given preoperatively → **omit at induction**

### 4.3 Optional Adjunct Boluses

> **Adjuncts blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, but do NOT replace hypnosis.**

#### Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct)

**Indication:** Opioid-sparing analgesia, blunt intubation response, NMDA antagonism

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | **0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (14–35 mg for 70 kg) | **Higher end (0.5 mg/kg) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | High delirium risk |
| **Frail** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | Hemodynamic fragility |
| **Hemodynamic instability** | **Omit** | Risk outweighs benefit |
| **Severe tachyarrhythmia risk** | **Omit** | Sympathetic stimulation undesirable |

**EEG monitoring caveat:**
- Ketamine may **increase BIS** and alter EEG-derived indices
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine administration
- Correlate with clinical context and raw EEG trends when available

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or unstable psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury or increased IOP
- Catecholamine-depleted physiology

#### Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Protocol 2 Specific Adjunct)

**Role:** Systemic analgesia, anti-inflammatory effects, opioid-sparing

> **Protocol 2 Note:** Lidocaine infusion is more commonly used in Protocol 2 (vs Protocol 1) as an additional systemic adjunct to compensate for lack of regional blocks.

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail/Hepatic Impairment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | **1–1.5 mg/kg/hr** | **1 mg/kg/hr maximum** | Start after induction once hemodynamically stable |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Use infusion pump for accuracy |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | Per institutional protocol |
| **Total Duration** | Typically <2–3 hours | <2 hours preferred | Institutional maximum often 3 hours |

**Contraindications:**
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** - absolute
- **Complete heart block without pacemaker** - absolute
- **Amide local anesthetic allergy** - absolute
- **Severe cardiac conduction disease** - relative (use with caution)

**Monitoring for CNS Toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, agitation, seizures
- **Action:** Stop infusion immediately if any signs/symptoms; prepare for LAST management

**Why Lidocaine Infusion in Protocol 2:**
- Compensates for lack of regional blocks
- Evidence for reduced opioid consumption and improved recovery
- Synergistic with other OFIA adjuncts
- Generally well-tolerated when dosed conservatively

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions do NOT use lidocaine infusions
- Verify local policy and formulary availability
- May require specific credentialing or approval

#### Magnesium Sulfate Maintenance (If Loaded)

**Role:** NMDA antagonism, mild analgesia

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Maintenance Rate** | 8–10 mg/kg/hr if loading dose given |
| **Duration** | Continue until skin closure |
| **Warning** | Potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate prolonged paralysis |

**Monitoring:**
- TOF monitoring essential (see Section 8.3)
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

## 5. Maintenance Anesthesia

> **Maintenance ensures continuous unconsciousness while OFIA adjuncts provide analgesia and sympatholysis.**
> Processed EEG indices must be interpreted in clinical context and **must not be used as the sole determinant of anesthetic depth**, particularly when ketamine, hypothermia, or neuromodulatory adjuncts are present.

### 5.1 Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity

**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by propofol and/or sevoflurane.**

> **Cross-Reference:** See [Protocol Comparison Table - Maintenance Anesthesia](Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#maintenance-anesthesia) for complete options and detailed safety profiles.

**Choose ONE of the following hypnotic strategies:**

#### Option A: Propofol TIVA (Preferred for Protocol 2)

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to depth monitors) | Antiemetic properties; precise control; MH-safe |
| **Monitoring** | Consider processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in elderly/frail | Reduces risk of excessive depth |
| **Default Pathway** | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; institutional preference | Best for Protocol 2 goals |

#### Option B: Sevoflurane

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **0.7–1 MAC** (age-adjusted; see table below) | Familiar; easy titration; rapid offset |
| **Monitoring** | End-tidal agent monitoring | Standard volatile technique |
| **Default Pathway** | Standard workflow; not high PONV risk; volatile-capable machine | Widely available |

**Age-Adjusted MAC Reduction for Sevoflurane:**

| Age Range | MAC Reduction | Effective MAC Range |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Age 65–75** | Reduce by ~20% | 0.56–0.8 MAC |
| **Age 75–85** | Reduce by ~30–40% | 0.42–0.7 MAC |
| **Age >85** | Reduce by ~40–50% | 0.35–0.6 MAC |

#### Option C: Balanced (Propofol + Sevoflurane)

| Component | Details | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Dosing** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + Sevoflurane 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce total dose of each |
| **Complexity** | More challenging titration | Requires experience with hybrid technique |
| **Default Pathway** | Institutional preference or specific clinical scenarios | Not routine for Protocol 2 |

---

### 5.2 OFIA Adjuncts (Supplement Hypnosis - Do NOT Replace)

> **Critical Understanding:**
> - Adjuncts provide **analgesia and sympatholysis**
> - Adjuncts do **NOT** provide surgical hypnosis
> - Adjuncts allow **dose reduction** of propofol/sevoflurane while maintaining depth
> - **Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness**

#### Dexmedetomidine Infusion

**Role:** Sedation, sympatholysis, opioid-sparing analgesia (NOT primary hypnosis)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum | **Higher end (0.7 mcg/kg/hr) may be used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks; NO bolus loading |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Titrate to effect |
| **Stop Time** | 10–15 min before case end | 10–15 min before case end | Prevents prolonged sedation |

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Continuous HR/BP monitoring
- **Stop if HR <50 with symptoms** or **<45 regardless of symptoms**
- **Reduce or stop** if hypotension (MAP <60) unresponsive to fluids/vasopressors

**Bradycardia Management:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **Then:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **Consider:** Discontinuing dexmedetomidine if recurrent

**Contraindications:**
- High-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Severe baseline bradycardia (HR <50 at baseline)
- Severe baseline hypotension (MAP <60 mmHg)

#### Ketamine Infusion (Optional)

**Role:** Analgesia, dissociation, NMDA antagonism (NOT reliable unconsciousness)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr | 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or **omit** | **Higher end (0.25 mg/kg/hr) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Start Time** | After induction | After induction | If bolus given at induction |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | May omit entirely in high-risk |

**BIS Monitoring Caveat:**
- Ketamine **dissociates cortical activity** and may increase BIS
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine
- Correlate with clinical context (movement, autonomic signs, raw EEG trends)

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury

#### Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Protocol 2 Specific Adjunct)

**Role:** Systemic analgesia, anti-inflammatory effects, opioid-sparing

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail/Hepatic Impairment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | **1–1.5 mg/kg/hr** | **1 mg/kg/hr maximum** | Start after induction once hemodynamically stable |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Use infusion pump for accuracy |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | Per institutional protocol |
| **Total Duration** | Typically <2–3 hours | <2 hours preferred | Institutional maximum often 3 hours |

**Contraindications:**
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** - absolute
- **Complete heart block without pacemaker** - absolute
- **Amide local anesthetic allergy** - absolute
- **Severe cardiac conduction disease** - relative (use with caution)

**Monitoring for CNS Toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, agitation, seizures
- **Action:** Stop infusion immediately if any signs/symptoms; prepare for LAST management

**Why Lidocaine Infusion in Protocol 2:**
- Compensates for lack of regional blocks
- Evidence for reduced opioid consumption and improved recovery
- Synergistic with other OFIA adjuncts
- Generally well-tolerated when dosed conservatively

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions do NOT use lidocaine infusions
- Verify local policy and formulary availability
- May require specific credentialing or approval

## 6. Emergence

> **Emergence is a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning and controlled execution.**

### 6.1 Pre-Emergence Planning (10–15 Minutes Before Anticipated End)

**Goal:** Smooth, controlled emergence without prolonged sedation or delayed extubation.

**Actions:**

| Time Point | Action | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **15 min before end** | Taper or stop dexmedetomidine | Prevent prolonged sedation |
| **15 min before end** | Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing (50–75 mcg/kg/min) | Begin lightening depth |
| **10 min before end** | Plan ketamine discontinuation (if used) | Minimize dissociative effects |
| **10 min before end** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if used) | Per institutional protocol |
| **10 min before end** | Verify TOF monitor functioning and ready | Essential for reversal timing |
| **At skin closure** | Stop ketamine infusion | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop dexmedetomidine (if not already) | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if not already) | — |

**Communication:**
- Inform surgical team of anticipated emergence timing
- Confirm no additional procedures planned
- Verify dressing application plan

### 6.2 Hypnotic Reduction

**Propofol TIVA:**
- Taper to 25–50 mcg/kg/min at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Sevoflurane:**
- Reduce to 0.4–0.6 MAC at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Do NOT:**
- Abruptly stop hypnotic before patient ready to emerge
- Rely on adjuncts alone (dexmedetomidine is NOT sufficient for unconsciousness)

### 6.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

#### Ondansetron

**Timing:** Before emergence or at skin closure

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **All patients** | **4 mg IV** | If not already given preoperatively |
| **High PONV risk** | 4 mg IV (in addition to scopolamine patch) | May repeat 4 mg in PACU if needed |

#### Neuromuscular Reversal

> **Critical:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 is **MANDATORY** before extubation. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a patient safety risk.

**Sugammadex Dosing:**

> **Renal safety:** **Sugammadex is not recommended in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), including dialysis**, due to prolonged exposure and limited safety data. Use only in accordance with institutional policy and attending anesthesiologist judgment.

| TOF Status | Dose | Wait Time | Expected Outcome |
|------------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **TOF count ≥2, ratio <0.9** | **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF ratio ≥0.9 |
| **Deep block (TOF 1–2)** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF count ≥2, then reassess |
| **Post-tetanic count only** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | May require additional time |

**After sugammadex administration:**
1. Wait 2–3 minutes
2. Reassess TOF ratio
3. **Confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9** before proceeding to extubation
4. If TOF <0.9 → wait longer or consider additional sugammadex (consult attending)

**Special Considerations:**
- **Magnesium potentiates NMB:** May need higher sugammadex dose or longer wait time
- **Obesity:** Dose sugammadex to **total body weight** (not IBW)
- **Mild–moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 and <80 mL/min):**
  - No routine dose adjustment required
  - Clearance is prolonged; monitor closely

- **Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min, including dialysis):**
  - **Sugammadex is not recommended**
  - Follow institutional reversal pathway and attending decision-making

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met before extubation:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Target |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Consciousness** | Patient opens eyes to command, squeezes hand | Awake and follows commands |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Count breaths over 15 seconds | 10–20 breaths/min |
| **Tidal Volume** | Observe chest rise or measure with spirometry | ≥5 mL/kg (≥350 mL for 70 kg) |
| **Oxygenation** | Pulse oximetry | SpO₂ ≥95% on 100% O₂ (≥92% if chronic lung disease) |
| **Neuromuscular Function** | TOF monitoring | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 (mandatory)** |
| **Hemodynamics** | Continuous monitoring | MAP ≥65 mmHg or near baseline |
| **No Active Bleeding** | Surgical team confirmation | No ongoing hemorrhage or concern |

**Additional Clinical Assessment:**
- Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
- Sustained grip strength bilaterally
- Sustained tongue protrusion
- No fasciculations
- Adequate cough and gag reflex

**Do NOT Extubate If:**
- Any somnolence remains
- TOF <0.9
- Inadequate respiratory effort (RR <10, TV <5 mL/kg)
- Hemodynamic instability
- Active bleeding or surgical concern
- Patient confused or combative

**Special Populations:**

| Population | Additional Considerations |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Elderly (>75)** | Lower threshold to delay extubation; ensure fully awake |
| **Frail** | Extended observation before extubation decision |
| **OSA** | More stringent criteria; ensure robust ventilation |
| **Cardiac Disease** | Ensure hemodynamic stability before airway manipulation |

### 6.5 Post-Extubation Care

**Immediate post-extubation:**
- Apply supplemental O₂ (nasal cannula 2–4 L/min or simple face mask 6–8 L/min)
- Continue standard ASA monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP, RR)
- Position patient semi-upright (30–45 degrees if not contraindicated)
- Suction oropharyngeal secretions as needed
- Monitor for signs of airway obstruction (stridor, desaturation, increased work of breathing)

**Pain and Emergence Delirium Management:**
- **If moderate to severe pain (NRS ≥4):**
  - Consider parenteral acetaminophen 1g IV
  - Administer short-acting opioids if necessary (e.g., morphine 1–2 mg IV) 
  - Start opioid-sparing oral medications (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as soon as tolerated
  - Reassess pain at 15-minute intervals until pain is controlled

- **Emergence delirium (common in children, frail elderly, and OSA):**
  - Monitor closely for agitation or confusion
  - Reorient and reassure the patient
  - Administer low-dose benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam 0.5 mg IV) if agitation persists
  - Assess for hypoxia and hypercarbia

**Repositioning and Airway Management:**
- Ensure patient remains in **semi-upright position** unless contraindicated (e.g., abdominal surgery, severe hypotension)
- Consider using a **soft oral airway** or **nasal cannula with higher O₂ flow** if signs of airway obstruction
- For **OSA patients**: Place on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or BiPAP as per institutional protocol

**Oxygen Saturation Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring should continue in the PACU or monitored recovery area
- **SpO₂ ≥92%** is the goal; administer supplemental oxygen to maintain target range
- **If SpO₂ <90%** for more than 2 minutes: Consider CPAP or BiPAP
- **If SpO₂ remains <85%** for more than 5 minutes: Reassess for possible re-intubation or escalation of airway management

## 7. Postoperative Pain Management

**Pain Management Approach (Opioid-Sparing):**
- **Primary Strategy:** NSAIDs and acetaminophen for mild to moderate pain
- **Adjuncts:** Gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin 300 mg PO) and local anesthesia as indicated

| Medication | Dose | Route | Timing | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | IV/PO | Q6H | Continue until POD 2-3 |
| **Ibuprofen** | 400–600 mg | PO | Q6H | Consider for mild-moderate pain; use with caution in renal dysfunction |
| **Gabapentin** | 300 mg | PO | Daily | Start on POD 1 to reduce opioid use |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | Single dose preop | Continue 200 mg daily for 2–3 days |
| **Opioids** | As needed | IV/PO | PRN | Use as a last resort for breakthrough pain (e.g., morphine 1-2 mg IV, hydrocodone 5 mg PO) |
| **Lidocaine patches** | 1–2 patches | Topical | Q12H | Apply to surgical site for localized pain |

### 7.1 Monitoring for Pain Management Side Effects
- **Monitor for PONV (postoperative nausea/vomiting):**  
  - If high risk (Apfel score ≥3), administer antiemetic prophylaxis (e.g., ondansetron 4 mg IV)
  - **Treat PONV if it occurs** with standard antiemetics, avoiding opioids

- **Sedation Levels:**  
  - If opioids are used, monitor **RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale)** to avoid over-sedation
  - **RASS Score -2 or below:** Reassess sedation level and consider reducing opioid dose
  - **Avoid excessive opioid administration**: Utilize multimodal analgesia for best results

### 7.2 Special Considerations for High-Risk Populations
- **Elderly/Frail:**  
  - **Lower threshold for opioid use**: Given the risk of delirium, use the smallest effective dose and start with non-opioid agents.
  - **Frequent reassessment** of pain and sedation levels is critical, especially if there are signs of cognitive decline.

- **Chronic Opioid Users:**  
  - **Continue chronic opioid regimen** in the immediate postoperative period to avoid withdrawal symptoms
  - **Enhanced rescue analgesia**: Anticipate higher pain levels and opioid needs postoperatively
  - **Monitor for opioid tolerance** and ensure a planned transition to multimodal analgesia as the acute pain phase resolves

## 8. Safety Monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring in PACU:**
- **Vital signs:** Continuous monitoring of BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, and temperature
- **Level of Consciousness:** RASS score every 15 minutes until stable
- **Pain Level:** Document NRS (numeric rating scale) for pain at regular intervals (every 15 minutes initially)
- **Oxygenation:** Continuous pulse oximetry; consider CO2 monitoring for OSA or high-risk patients
- **Temperature:** Monitor body temperature to avoid hypothermia, especially if significant fluid shifts or long operative time

### 8.1 Neuromuscular Blockade Reversal Monitoring
- **TOF (Train-of-Four) Monitoring:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 must be achieved before extubation.  
  - **Goal:** Ensure no residual neuromuscular blockade remains to prevent hypoventilation post-extubation.
  - **TOF 0–1:** Sugammadex 2–4 mg/kg based on depth of block.
  - **Post-reversal:** Confirm normal hand strength, cough, and head lift for extubation readiness.

## 9. Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Inadequate analgesia (NRS >4)** | Inadequate periarticular infiltration, inadequate opioid-sparing regimen | Administer additional non-opioid analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen), consider low-dose opioid (morphine 1–2 mg IV) |
| **Hypotension (MAP <60 mmHg)** | Propofol bolus, hypovolemia, insufficient vasoactive support | Administer IV fluids (500 mL bolus), initiate phenylephrine or ephedrine as needed, reduce propofol infusion |
| **Bradycardia (HR <50 bpm)** | Dexmedetomidine, inadequate sympathetic tone | Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion, administer atropine 0.5 mg IV, assess for other causes of bradycardia |
| **Emergence delirium (confusion, agitation)** | Rapid emergence, residual anesthetic agents, hypoxia | Ensure adequate O₂ supplementation, allow time for emergence, administer benzodiazepines if needed (lorazepam 0.5 mg IV) |
| **Oxygen desaturation (SpO₂ <90%)** | OSA, airway obstruction, respiratory depression | Reposition patient, provide CPAP if OSA suspected, administer supplemental oxygen, consider CPAP or BiPAP for severe cases |

### 9.2 Early Warning Signs for Severe Complications
- **Hypoxia (SpO₂ <85%):** Immediate action required—administer high-flow O₂, reposition patient, assess for airway obstruction, prepare for possible re-intubation
- **Severe hypotension (MAP <50 mmHg):** Initiate vasoactive medications (phenylephrine or ephedrine), bolus IV fluids
- **Severe bradycardia (HR <40):** Administer atropine, stop dexmedetomidine, consider pacing if necessary

## 10. Clinical Pearls

### 10.1 Regional Analgesia and Block-Free Considerations

1. **Surgeon periarticular infiltration is critical:**  
   Without regional blocks, periarticular infiltration with 100-150 mL of **ropivacaine 0.2%** is essential for maintaining postoperative analgesia. Ensure surgeon documentation of infiltration volume, concentration, and total dose to track systemic local anesthetic (LA) burden.

2. **Expect higher postoperative pain levels (NRS 2–5):**  
   Without regional blocks, **pain control is more challenging**, and patients may report slightly higher pain scores compared to **Protocol 1**. Ensure **multimodal analgesia** is optimized, including adjuncts like **ketamine, lidocaine infusion**, and **NSAIDs**. If pain levels exceed NRS 4, reassess analgesic strategy promptly.

3. **Lidocaine infusion can bridge the gap:**  
   **Lidocaine infusions** in Protocol 2 provide valuable systemic analgesia when regional blocks are omitted. **Start lidocaine infusion after induction** to help reduce opioid consumption and improve pain control during surgery. **Monitor for CNS toxicity** signs like dizziness, tinnitus, and confusion, and have LAST treatment protocols ready.

4. **Ketamine’s role in pain and sympatholysis:**  
   Use **ketamine infusions (0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr)** to **blunt the sympathetic response** and provide **opioid-sparing analgesia**. Ketamine also helps to prevent **peripheral sensitization**. Be cautious in elderly, frail patients, or those with **hemodynamic instability** due to its sympathomimetic effects.

5. **No reliance on BIS alone for anesthetic depth:**  
   While **processed EEG** monitoring (e.g., BIS) is useful, **do not rely solely on BIS** when ketamine or other adjuncts are used. Always correlate BIS with **clinical signs** (e.g., movement, eye opening) and **raw EEG** if available. This ensures a more accurate assessment of depth of anesthesia.

6. **Pain management at emergence:**  
   In Protocol 2, **pain management in the PACU** may be less predictable compared to Protocol 1, due to the absence of regional blocks. **Use non-opioid strategies** as first-line treatment, and be ready to administer **low-dose opioids** (e.g., morphine 1-2 mg IV) if pain exceeds NRS 4. Be mindful of **PONV risks** and incorporate multimodal antiemetic strategies.

7. **Avoid over-sedation in elderly or frail patients:**  
   Adjust dosing for **elderly** and **frail** patients to minimize risks of over-sedation. **Use lower doses of adjuncts** (e.g., **dexmedetomidine**, **ketamine**) and avoid high initial doses to reduce the risk of delirium, bradycardia, and hypotension. **Frequent re-assessment** of sedation depth is crucial.

8. **Avoid excessive dosing of dexmedetomidine:**  
   In **Protocol 2**, dexmedetomidine is often used as a sedative and sympatholytic adjunct. However, **avoid high bolus doses** as they can lead to **bradycardia** and **hypotension**, particularly in elderly or frail patients. A continuous infusion is preferred over bolus administration.

9. **Protocol 2 is an alternative when regional blocks are not possible:**  
   If **regional blocks** are contraindicated (e.g., **anticoagulation timing**, **patient refusal**, **anatomical issues**), **Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)** offers an effective **opioid-free** alternative. It maintains the goal of **opioid minimization**, though with **higher expected pain levels** and a greater need for postoperative pain management.

10. **Monitor for signs of LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity):**  
    **LAST** is always a concern with any **local anesthetic** use, including **surgeon periarticular infiltration**. Ensure **lipid emulsion** is immediately available and that **cumulative local anesthetic doses** are tracked to avoid toxicity. Be aware of early signs such as **perioral numbness**, **tinnitus**, and **dizziness**.

11. **Increased need for PACU rescue analgesia in Protocol 2:**  
    Without regional blocks, patients undergoing **Protocol 2** will likely need more **rescue analgesia** in the **PACU**. Be prepared with **opioid-sparing options** like **ketamine**, **magnesium**, and **lidocaine** for breakthrough pain, but be ready to administer **low-dose opioids** if needed.

12. **Protocol 2 provides fast workflow with no block setup required:**  
    One of the **main advantages** of Protocol 2 is its **faster workflow**, as there is no need for **block placement**. This is particularly beneficial when **time constraints** or **staffing limitations** are present, or when **blocks** are contraindicated or refused by the patient.

13. **Key benefit: no need for regional block contraindication workarounds:**  
    For patients who are not candidates for regional blocks, **Protocol 2** is a strong alternative that does not require complex workarounds. This streamlines the anesthetic plan and ensures that **opioid-free** anesthesia is maintained.

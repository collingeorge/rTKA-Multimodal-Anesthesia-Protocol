# Protocol 2 – Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) Without Nerve Blocks (rTKA)

Block-free opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) when regional blocks are not feasible or not desired. This protocol aims to preserve the benefits of OFIA (low PONV, smooth emergence, early mobilization) by relying on multimodal systemic adjuncts and **surgeon periarticular infiltration** instead of ACB/IPACK.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS 2024, ASA/APSF 2024, and ASRA 2024–2025 guidance but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized, especially in elderly, frail, OSA, or significant comorbidity.  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Dose adjustments and contraindications for special populations are detailed in  
>   **`Adjuncts_Contraindications_Safety.md`** and should be applied here.

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthetic without nerve blocks** for rTKA. It is generally used when:

- The patient **declines nerve blocks** after counseling.
- **ASRA timing** prevents safe ACB/IPACK (e.g., DOAC within recent window, therapeutic/prophylactic LMWH outside timing).
- **Rapid workflow is required** and block placement would unduly delay the case.
- **Anatomical difficulties** (e.g., severe obesity, prior surgery, limited ultrasound windows) make blocks difficult or unsafe.

> **Position in Algorithm:**  
> - When feasible, **Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK)** is generally preferred first-line.  
> - When regional blocks are not feasible but OFIA components are appropriate, **Protocol 2** is typically preferred over a conventional opioid-based pathway (Protocol 3).

---

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment

Same core assessment as Protocol 1 and Protocol 3:

- Comprehensive history and exam:
  - ASA classification, airway exam, METs, allergies.
- **Opioid history:**
  - Document chronic opioid use (drug, dose, MME/day).
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV history (critical for OFIA vs opioid-based comparison).
  - Frailty/cognition (especially elderly >70–80).
  - OSA screening (STOP-Bang, home CPAP/BiPAP).
- Anticoagulation:
  - Confirm **why blocks are not being performed** (ASRA timing, patient refusal, workflow, anatomy).

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed)

Typical adult regimen (individualize for renal/hepatic function and comorbidities):

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO**  
  - 30–60 minutes pre-op (max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease or low body weight).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO**  
  - 1–2 hours pre-op, if no significant renal/CV or GI contraindication.  
  - Alternative: **Meloxicam 15 mg PO** per surgical/medicine guidance.
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV**  
  - After IV placement (PONV prophylaxis + analgesic synergy).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch**  
  - Evening prior or ≥2 hours pre-op for **high PONV risk** patients without contraindications.
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** in holding area  
  - Consider **1 mg or less** in frail, elderly, or OSA patients; avoid in severe baseline cognitive impairment when possible.
- **Continue home opioid dose** morning of surgery for **chronic opioid users** per pain/attending guidance (continuation of baseline therapy does not violate the OFIA intraoperative goal).
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** (ASA/APSF 2024 cautions regarding sedation, delirium, and respiratory risk).

### 2.3 Documentation and Surgeon Coordination

- In the pre-op note, explicitly document:  
  - “**Block omitted due to**: ____ (anticoagulation timing, patient refusal, workflow constraints, anatomical difficulty, attending decision).”
- Confirm with surgeon:
  - **Periarticular infiltration will be performed** as a critical component of this pathway.
  - Record planned local anesthetic volume, concentration, and additives.
- Ensure awareness of **maximum safe local anesthetic dose** (see `Adjuncts_Contraindications_Safety.md`) and plan to track cumulative dose.

## 3. Induction

> Doses below are **typical adult ranges** for otherwise stable patients; reduce in frail, elderly, and hemodynamically unstable patients.

### 3.1 Pre-Oxygenation

- 100% FiO₂ via tight-fitting mask for **3–5 minutes** before induction.

### 3.2 Induction Sequence (OFIA, Block-Free)

- **Midazolam 0.5–1 mg IV**  
  - Additional small doses as needed; consider prior pre-op midazolam.
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV**  
  - Typical induction range; consider **1–1.5 mg/kg** in frail/cardiac patients.
- **Ketamine 0.4–0.5 mg/kg IV**  
  - Slightly **higher induction dose** than when regional blocks are used; provides strong NMDA antagonism and analgesia.
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
  - Based on ideal or adjusted body weight; confirm depth with TOF.

### 3.3 Optional Loading Adjuncts

- **Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg IV over 10–20 minutes (optional)**  
  - If planning a maintenance infusion; avoid rapid bolus.  
  - Use lower/omitted loading dose in frail or bradycardic patients.
- **Magnesium sulfate 30–50 mg/kg IV over 15–20 minutes (typical ~40 mg/kg ≈ 3 g for 70 kg)**  
  - Avoid in **CrCl <30 mL/min**; reduce dose in moderate renal impairment (see adjuncts doc).

### 3.4 Airway Management

- ETT vs LMA choice based on:
  - Surgical requirements, aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, positioning.
- Confirm placement:
  - **Continuous ETCO₂ waveform** ± auscultation as indicated.
- Secure device and document:
  - **Cormack–Lehane grade**, ease of intubation, and any airway adjuncts used.

---

## 4. Maintenance

### 4.1 Anesthetic Maintenance (Choose One)

- **Sevoflurane ~0.8–1.2 MAC (age-adjusted)**  
  - Common first choice at many centers for rTKA; easily titratable.

  **OR**

- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min**  
  - Consider in **very high PONV risk** or MH susceptibility, or by practitioner preference.  
  - Use dedicated IV line and infusion pump; track cumulative dose (PRIS risk negligible for 1–3 h case).

### 4.2 Adjunct Infusions (Core OFIA Components)

- **Dexmedetomidine 0.3–0.7 mcg/kg/hr**  
  - Often at the higher end of the range in this block-free pathway to compensate for lack of regional analgesia.  
  - Use **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** in elderly, frail, or bradycardic patients.
- **Ketamine 0.15–0.25 mg/kg/hr**  
  - Higher end of range compared to block-based OFIA to maintain analgesia.
- **Optional: Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr**  
  - Max **~300 mg total intraoperatively**; avoid in severe hepatic impairment.  
  - Monitor for CNS toxicity; ensure lipid rescue availability.

> **Key Principle:**  
> **No intraoperative opioids** are given in this pathway. Analgesia is provided by ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium, local infiltration, and non-opioid multimodal strategies. Postoperative opioid rescue is allowed when clinically indicated and does not constitute “failure” of OFIA.

### 4.3 Hemodynamic Management

- **Target MAP ≥65 mmHg**, individualizing for CAD or cerebrovascular disease.
- Typical vasopressor strategy:
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** boluses if hypotension with HR >70.
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** boluses if hypotension with HR <60.
- **Dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia:**
  - Monitor HR; treat if HR <50 with symptoms or HR <45 regardless.
  - **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** often preferred over atropine (longer duration, less tachycardia).
  - Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion if bradycardia/hypotension persists.

### 4.4 Intraoperative Monitoring

- Standard ASA monitors:
  - ECG, NIBP or arterial line (per risk), SpO₂, ETCO₂, temperature.
- **Agent analyzer** for MAC/expired agent concentration (if using sevoflurane).
- Neuromuscular monitoring:
  - TOF to guide rocuronium dosing and reversal.
- Consider depth-of-anesthesia monitoring (e.g., BIS):
  - Particularly in elderly or in high-dose adjunct combinations to avoid over-sedation.

## 5. Emergence

### 5.1 Late Intraoperative Period (10–15 Minutes Before End)

- **Stop dexmedetomidine infusion** to allow clearance before emergence.
- Continue ketamine infusion until **skin closure** is complete.
- **Stop lidocaine infusion** if used.

### 5.2 At Skin Closure

- **Stop ketamine infusion**.
- Adjust anesthetic depth:
  - Reduce sevoflurane toward **~0.5–0.7 MAC** or taper propofol infusion (~50% reduction) in preparation for emergence.

### 5.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV**  
  - OFIA pathways have lower PONV, but prophylaxis remains standard.
- Neuromuscular reversal:
  - **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV** when TOF count ≥2 but TOF ratio <0.9.  
  - **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV** for deeper block (1–2 post-tetanic counts).  
  - Use per institutional policy; see adjuncts document for renal considerations.

### 5.4 Extubation Criteria

- **Neurologic:**
  - Awake or easily arousable, following commands, eyes open.
- **Ventilation:**
  - Tidal volume >5 mL/kg, RR ~10–20 breaths/min.
  - SpO₂ >92% on room air or minimal supplemental O₂.
  - No paradoxical, labored, or obstructed breathing.
- **Neuromuscular:**
  - TOF ratio ≥0.9 or objective confirmation of adequate reversal.
- **Hemodynamic:**
  - MAP ≥60–65 mmHg; HR in reasonable range for patient.

**Expected Profile:**

- **Smooth extubation** with minimal coughing/bucking.
- Rapid return to baseline mentation:
  - Typically **alert and oriented in PACU within ~10–15 minutes**.

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia Plan

### 6.1 Surgeon Periarticular Infiltration (Critical Component)

Because this pathway is **block-free**, surgeon periarticular infiltration is **essential**:

- **Example technique (illustrative):**
  - Volume: **~100–150 mL of dilute local anesthetic**, such as ropivacaine 0.2%.  
  - This corresponds to **~200–300 mg ropivacaine total**.
- **Safety constraints:**
  - Keep total **ropivacaine dose ≤~3 mg/kg** (for a 70 kg patient, ≤~210 mg is a conservative target).  
  - Higher total doses are used in some LIA protocols but carry greater LAST risk; this framework emphasizes **weight-based capping** and documentation.
- **Optional additives:**
  - Epinephrine 1:200,000 (5 mcg/mL), ketorolac 30 mg IV or added to the solution per institutional practice.
- **Timing:**
  - Typically performed before or at closure.
- **Sites:**
  - Posterior capsule, periarticular tissues, and subcutaneous layers per surgical protocol.
- **Documentation:**
  - Record **total local anesthetic dose** and additives for LAST risk assessment.

### 6.2 Expected PACU Pain Scores

- Without blocks:
  - **NRS ~3–6/10** is typical early post-op despite OFIA, driven by surgical trauma and infiltration profile.
- Counsel the patient preoperatively:
  - Slightly higher early pain than with blocks (Protocol 1) is expected but often acceptable given advantages (no needles, anticoagulation flexibility).

### 6.3 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia

Continue or initiate:

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h**  
  - Max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease or low weight.
- **NSAID** (if no contraindication):
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h **OR**
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day; typically limited to 48–72 hours; renal function permitting) **OR**
  - Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily per surgical/medicine guidance.

### 6.4 Rescue Analgesia (Stepwise)

1. **First-Line (Opioid-Free Rescue): Ketamine**

   - **Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 minutes PRN** for NRS ≥4.  
   - Limit to **~3 boluses** (total ~0.3–0.45 mg/kg).  
   - Monitor for dysphoria or emergence phenomena (rare at these rescue doses).  
   - Reassess pain and mental status after each dose.

2. **Second-Line (Opioid Rescue When Needed): Hydromorphone**

   - **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 minutes PRN** if ketamine rescue inadequate.  
   - Use the **minimal effective cumulative dose**, with careful reassessment after each dose:
     - Pain level (NRS), sedation (RASS), RR, and SpO₂.  
   - Enhanced monitoring if **elderly, frail, OSA, or opioid-naïve**:
     - Continuous pulse oximetry in PACU and possible extended monitoring on the floor.

### 6.5 Non-Pharmacologic Measures

- Ice application to surgical site.
- Limb elevation and supportive positioning.
- Reassurance, coaching on realistic expectations, and anxiety management.

### 6.6 Mobilization and Infiltration Duration

- **Infiltration duration:** Typically **~6–8 hours** of meaningful analgesic effect.
- **Transition plan:**
  - Ensure oral multimodal regimen is in place **before** infiltration wears off.
  - Anticipate **increased analgesic needs around 6–8 hours** post-op; plan proactive dosing.
- **Mobilization target:**  
  - Ambulation on **POD 0** when pain is controlled and patient is alert:
    - Typically **4–6 hours post-op**.
- Physical therapy evaluation when:
  - Alert and oriented (RASS ~0).  
  - Pain **≤4/10**.  
  - Hemodynamically stable.  
  - PONV controlled.  
  - No excessive sedation.

## 7. Notes, Clinical Context, and Contraindications

### 7.1 Clinical Advantages

- **Faster workflow** vs block-based OFIA (no block room time; often ~15 minutes saved).
- **No anticoagulation timing constraints** related to peripheral nerve blocks.
- **Immediate motor strength** (no block-related motor impairment).
- Maintains key OFIA benefits:
  - Generally **lower PONV** (~10–20%) vs conventional opioid pathways (~30–40%).  
  - Smooth emergence and low delirium risk in most patients.
  - Early mobilization (POD 0) is feasible with adequate analgesia.

### 7.2 Expected Differences Compared with OFIA + Blocks (Protocol 1)

- **Higher early pain scores** (NRS ~3–6 vs ~0–3 with ACB/IPACK).
- **More frequent rescue medications** in PACU (predominantly ketamine).
- **Surgeon infiltration is critical**, not optional:
  - Outcomes are highly dependent on high-quality periarticular infiltration plus systemic multimodal therapy.

### 7.3 Ideal Patient Population

- Anticoagulation preventing safe ACB/IPACK:
  - e.g., recent DOAC or LMWH doses **outside ASRA timing windows**.
- Patient refusal of regional blocks (needles, numbness, or personal preference).
- Workflow constraints:
  - Add-on cases, limited block room capacity, time-sensitive scheduling.
- Anatomical challenges:
  - Severe obesity, prior surgeries, or anatomy limiting block feasibility.

### 7.4 Key Principles (Protocol 2)

- **Midazolam** provides preoperative anxiolysis and does **not** compromise the OFIA principle.
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg** remains the typical induction range across all rTKA pathways.
- **Sevoflurane and propofol TIVA** are both acceptable maintenance choices:
  - Sevoflurane for standard workflow and familiarity.  
  - Propofol TIVA for high PONV risk or MH susceptibility.
- **Higher ketamine and dexmedetomidine doses** (within safe ranges) are used compared with Protocol 1 to offset the lack of regional block–based analgesia.
- **Lidocaine infusion is optional** and should respect total dose limits and hepatic contraindications.
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration is essential**, not optional, for good outcomes.
- **Postoperative opioid rescue is available** when clinically indicated and does not mean the OFIA strategy has “failed”; the goal is to **avoid routine intraoperative opioid administration** and minimize overall opioid burden.

### 7.5 When to Avoid Protocol 2

Consider switching to **Protocol 3 (Conventional Opioid Pathway)** or another individualized anesthetic if:

- **OFIA components are contraindicated**, for example:
  - Acute psychosis (ketamine generally avoided).
  - High-degree AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine generally avoided).
  - Severe uncontrolled hypertension (e.g., SBP >180 mmHg) or severe CAD where higher-dose ketamine/dex use is undesirable.
- **Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min)** if magnesium and certain adjuncts are not desired.
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** where lidocaine infusions and high-dose adjuncts are unsafe.
- The **patient prefers a conventional opioid-based anesthetic** after counseling.
- Attending anesthesiologist determines that an opioid-based pathway is safer or more appropriate in the specific context.

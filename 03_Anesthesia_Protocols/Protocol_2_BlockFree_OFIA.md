# Protocol 2 – Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) Without Nerve Blocks (rTKA)

Block-free opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) when regional blocks (ACB/IPACK) are not feasible or not desired. This protocol preserves core OFIA objectives (opioid minimization intraoperatively, lower PONV in many patients, and ERAS-aligned early mobilization) by relying on systemic multimodal adjuncts and **surgeon periarticular infiltration (LIA)** instead of ACB/IPACK.

Protocols are **informed by** ERAS arthroplasty guidance (2019–2024 updates), ASA/APSF perioperative safety framing (2024), and ASRA/ESRA regional anesthesia principles (2024–2025) but **do not replace** institutional policies or attending anesthesiologist judgment.

> **Educational Use Only – Not a Clinical Guideline**  
> - All doses are **typical adult ranges** and must be individualized (elderly, frail, OSA, cardiac, renal/hepatic impairment).  
> - Pathway selection is **attending- and institution-dependent**.  
> - Apply adjunct contraindications and phenotype adjustments from: **`Protocol_Adjuncts_and_Contraindications.md`**.  
> - Conservative guardrails are intentional to reduce misuse and adverse-event risk.

## 1. Purpose and Indications

This pathway provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthetic without nerve blocks** for rTKA. It is used when:

- Patient **declines nerve blocks** after counseling.
- **ASRA/ESRA timing + institutional policy** prevents safe ACB/IPACK.
- Workflow/anatomy constraints make blocks impractical or unsafe.
- Attending preference based on patient-specific risk/benefit assessment.

> **Position in Algorithm**
> - When feasible, **Protocol 1 (OFIA + ACB/IPACK)** is generally preferred first-line.  
> - When blocks are not feasible but OFIA components are appropriate, **Protocol 2** is generally preferred over a conventional opioid-based pathway (Protocol 3).

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### 2.1 Patient Assessment
- Standard preanesthetic evaluation:
  - ASA class, airway exam, functional capacity/METs, allergies.
- Opioid history:
  - Document chronic opioid use (drug, dose, MME/day).
- Risk stratification:
  - PONV history/risk phenotype.
  - Frailty/cognition screen (especially age >70 or frail phenotype).
  - OSA screening (STOP-Bang, CPAP/BiPAP plan).
- **Document explicit reason blocks are omitted**:
  - Anticoagulation timing, patient refusal, workflow constraints, anatomy, or attending decision.
- Screen for ketamine caution contexts:
  - Hemodynamic instability, frailty/advanced age, tachyarrhythmia risk, catecholamine-depleted physiology, severe psychiatric disease.

### 2.2 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed)
Typical adult regimen (individualize for renal/hepatic function and comorbidities):

- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (30–60 min pre-op; adjust max daily dose to phenotype).
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (1–2 hr pre-op) if appropriate.  
  - Alternative: **Meloxicam 15 mg PO** per institutional guidance.
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** after IV placement (PONV prophylaxis + analgesic synergy).
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** (evening prior or ≥2 hr pre-op) for **high PONV-risk only**.
- **Midazolam 0.5–2 mg IV PRN** (lowest effective dose):
  - Consider **≤1 mg** in elderly/frail/OSA; avoid if high delirium-risk phenotype when possible.
  - If midazolam is used pre-op, avoid routine repeat dosing at induction.
- Chronic opioid users:
  - Continue baseline home opioid regimen morning of surgery per institutional policy (baseline continuation does not violate the OFIA *intraoperative* goal).
- **Avoid routine gabapentinoids** unless specifically indicated per institutional policy (sedation/delirium/respiratory risk signal in select phenotypes).

### 2.3 Documentation and Surgeon Coordination
- In the pre-op note, explicitly document:
  - “**ACB/IPACK omitted due to:** ____ (anticoagulation timing, refusal, workflow, anatomy, attending decision).”
- Confirm with surgeon:
  - **Periarticular infiltration (LIA) will be performed** as a critical component of this pathway.
  - Surgeon will document **drug(s), concentration(s), volume(s), additives**, and total dose (mg).
- Ensure a plan to track **cumulative local anesthetic exposure** and LAST readiness.

## 3. Induction (OFIA)

> Doses below are typical adult ranges; reduce in frail, elderly, or hemodynamically unstable patients.

### 3.1 Pre-Oxygenation
- 100% FiO₂ via tight-fitting mask for **3–5 minutes** (or per institutional standard).

### 3.2 Induction Sequence (Propofol-Based)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (primary hypnotic)  
  - Consider **~1–1.5 mg/kg** in frail/cardiac patients.
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV**  
  - Dose per ideal/adjusted body weight; guide redosing with TOF.
- **Midazolam 0–0.5 mg IV** only if needed  
  - Often omit if pre-op dose already given.

### 3.3 Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct)
Ketamine may be used as a **sub-anesthetic adjunct** (not a default induction agent) for antihyperalgesia and opioid-sparing analgesia.

- **Ketamine 0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (titrate; favor lower end in elderly/frail/hemodynamically fragile).

### 3.4 Ketamine Guardrails (Selection, Hemodynamics, BIS/EEG)
Use caution, reduce dose, or omit ketamine bolus/infusion when:
- Hemodynamic instability or escalating vasopressor requirement (suspected catecholamine-depleted physiology).
- Frailty/advanced age with limited reserve (delirium/prolonged recovery risk).
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk or contexts where sympathetic stimulation is undesirable.
- Active psychosis or unstable severe psychiatric disease (context-dependent).

**Depth monitoring caveat:** Ketamine can increase BIS and alter EEG-derived indices. Do not titrate hypnotic depth to BIS alone after ketamine; correlate clinically and with raw EEG trends when available.

### 3.5 Optional Adjunct Initiation (Selection-Dependent)
- **Dexmedetomidine:** infusion without routine loading dose  
  - Start **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** (lower end in elderly/frail; avoid bolus in fragile patients).
- **Magnesium sulfate 30–50 mg/kg IV** over 15–20 minutes  
  - Avoid if **CrCl <30 mL/min** or myasthenia gravis.

### 3.6 Airway Management
- ETT vs LMA based on surgical and patient factors (aspiration risk, BMI/OSA, positioning).
- Confirm placement with **continuous ETCO₂ waveform**.
- Document airway details (grade, adjuncts, complications if any).

## 4. Maintenance (OFIA)

### 4.1 Primary Maintenance (Propofol Default; Sevo Optional/Additive)
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (**default maintenance backbone**).
- **Optional sevoflurane ~0.5–1.2 MAC** may be added selectively (hybrid strategy, case length/complexity, emergence strategy, institutional preference).

### 4.2 Adjunct Infusions (Apply Guardrails)
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr**
  - Favor **0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** in elderly/frail/bradycardic phenotypes.
  - Reduce/stop if persistent bradycardia/hypotension.
- **Ketamine infusion 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr** (optional)
  - Favor lower end or omit in frail/elderly or unstable patients.
- **Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr** (**repository-standard adjunct in Protocol 2 unless contraindicated**)  
  - Start after induction once hemodynamically stable; use infusion pump.  
  - Apply institutional maximums/total-dose ceilings and contraindications (e.g., significant hepatic dysfunction, conduction disease without pacing, seizure threshold concerns).  
  - Monitor for CNS toxicity (perioral numbness, tinnitus, metallic taste, agitation, seizures) and stop immediately if suspected.

> **Key Principle:**  
> **No intraoperative opioids** are administered in this pathway. Postoperative opioid rescue remains available when clinically indicated.

### 4.3 Hemodynamic Management
- Target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, individualized for CAD/cerebrovascular disease.
- Vasopressors per institutional practice (examples):
  - Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV PRN (relative tachycardia).
  - Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV PRN (relative bradycardia).
- Dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia/hypotension:
  - Reduce/stop infusion if recurrent.
  - **Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV** if symptomatic per local protocol.

### 4.4 Monitoring
- Standard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP/arterial line as indicated, SpO₂, ETCO₂, temperature).
- TOF neuromuscular monitoring.
- Volatile agent analyzer if sevoflurane used.
- Consider processed EEG in elderly/frail, with ketamine caveat.

## 5. Emergence

### 5.1 10–15 Minutes Before End
- Taper/stop dexmedetomidine as tolerated.
- If ketamine infusion used, plan stop near closure.
- Stop lidocaine infusion per institutional practice (commonly near closure).

### 5.2 At Skin Closure
- Stop ketamine infusion (if used).
- Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing.
- If sevoflurane used, taper toward **~0.5–0.7 MAC** as tolerated.

### 5.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV**.
- Sugammadex per institutional policy:
  - **2 mg/kg** (TOF ≥2 but TOF ratio <0.9).
  - **4 mg/kg** (deep block).

### 5.4 Extubation Criteria
- Awake/easily arousable; follows commands.
- Adequate ventilation/oxygenation.
- TOF ratio ≥0.9.
- Hemodynamically stable.

## 6. Postoperative Analgesia Plan (Block-Free)

### 6.1 Surgeon Periarticular Infiltration (Critical Component)
Because this pathway is block-free, surgeon periarticular infiltration (LIA) is essential.

- Surgeon documents:
  - Total volume, concentration, total dose (mg), and additives.
- Safety:
  - Track cumulative local anesthetic exposure and follow institutional dose limits.
  - Confirm LAST preparedness (monitoring, 20% lipid emulsion accessible, response pathway).

> **Note on injection discomfort and pH:**  
> If any infiltration component is known to be painful on injection due to low pH (agent- and mixture-dependent), mitigation should follow **institutional LIA practice** (e.g., buffering/warming/slow infiltration technique). This is a **surgical technique** consideration and is separate from IV lidocaine infusion.

### 6.2 Expected Pain Profile
- Early pain scores are typically higher than Protocol 1 (blocks).
- Pre-op counseling should set expectations and clarify rescue sequencing.

### 6.3 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h** (max 4 g/day; adjust for liver disease/low weight).
- NSAID per institutional policy if appropriate.

### 6.4 Rescue Analgesia (Stepwise; Apply Guardrails)
1. **Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min PRN** (max ~3 boluses)  
   - Omit/reduce in frail/elderly, unstable, or tachyarrhythmia-prone patients.
2. **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10–15 min PRN** if inadequate response and clinically appropriate  
   - Enhanced respiratory monitoring, particularly in elderly/OSA/opioid-naïve phenotypes.

## 7. Notes and When to Avoid Protocol 2

### 7.1 Expected Differences vs Protocol 1
- Higher early pain and more frequent PACU rescue needs are expected.
- Outcomes depend on:
  - High-quality periarticular infiltration,
  - Reliable systemic multimodal therapy,
  - Conservative titration of sedatives/adjuncts.

### 7.2 Consider Alternative Pathway When:
- Adjunct contraindications make OFIA components inappropriate (e.g., clinically significant hemodynamic instability where dex/ketamine are undesirable).
- Attending determines conventional opioid-inclusive management is safer given physiology, monitoring environment, or case complexity.

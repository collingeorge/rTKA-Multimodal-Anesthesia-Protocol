# Opioid-Free Intraoperative Anesthesia (OFIA) — Block-Free Pathway

## 1. Purpose
Provide a block-free OFIA pathway for patients who:
- Decline blocks  
- Have ASRA contraindications (e.g., DOAC <72h, LMWH <12h therapeutic, LMWH <6h prophylactic)  
- Require rapid workflow without delay  
- Have anatomical difficulties preventing block placement

---

## 2. Preoperative Phase

### Patient Assessment
Same as Protocol 1:
- ASA classification, airway exam, METs, allergies
- Review opioid tolerance history
- Review PONV/delirium history
- Frailty/cognition assessment for elderly
- **Document reason blocks not performed**

### Medications (ERAS-aligned)
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO** (give 30-60 min pre-op)
- **Celecoxib 400 mg PO** (give 1-2 hours pre-op; or meloxicam 15 mg if alternative needed)
- **Dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV** (give after IV placement)
- **Scopolamine 1.5 mg patch** (evening prior or ≥2 hrs pre-op for high PONV risk)
- **Midazolam 1–2 mg IV** (preoperative anxiolysis in holding area)
- **No gabapentinoids** (ASA/APSF 2024)

### Documentation
- "Block omitted due to ___ (anticoagulation timing, patient refusal, rapid workflow, anatomical difficulty)."
- **Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular infiltration**
- Document periarticular plan: volume, concentration, additives

## 3. Induction

**Pre-Oxygenation:**
- 100% FiO2 via tight-fitting mask for 3-5 minutes

**Induction Sequence:**
- **Midazolam 0.5–1 mg IV** (additional if needed; patient already received 1-2 mg preop)
- **Propofol 1.5–2 mg/kg IV** (universal induction agent)
- **Ketamine 0.4–0.5 mg/kg IV** (higher dose than with blocks; NMDA antagonism)
- **Rocuronium 0.6–1.0 mg/kg IV** (neuromuscular blockade)

**Optional Loading Doses:**
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg IV over 10–20 min** (if using infusion; optional)
- **Magnesium sulfate 30–50 mg/kg IV over 15–20 min** (typical 40 mg/kg ≈ 3 g for 70 kg)

**Airway Management:**
- Endotracheal intubation or LMA per clinical judgment and surgical requirements
- Confirm ETCO2 waveform
- Secure airway device
- Document Cormack-Lehane grade if intubated

---

## 4. Maintenance

**Anesthetic Maintenance (Choose One):**
- **Sevoflurane 0.8–1.2 MAC** (preferred at UW for ease of titration)
  - OR
- **Propofol TIVA 75–150 mcg/kg/min** (preferred for high PONV risk or MH susceptibility)

**Adjunct Infusions:**
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.3–0.7 mcg/kg/hr** (slightly higher range than with blocks; lower 0.2-0.4 for elderly/frail)
- **Ketamine 0.15–0.25 mg/kg/hr** (higher end of range without blocks for enhanced analgesia)
- **Optional: Lidocaine infusion 1–2 mg/kg/hr** (max total dose 300 mg; consider for additional analgesia)

**Hemodynamic Management:**
- **Maintain MAP >65 mmHg**
  - **Phenylephrine 50-100 mcg IV** (preferred if HR >70)
  - **Ephedrine 5-10 mg IV** (preferred if HR <60)
- Monitor for dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia (HR <50)
  - Treat with **glycopyrrolate 0.2-0.4 mg IV** (preferred over atropine - longer duration, less tachycardia)

**Key Principle:**
- **No intraoperative opioids**

**Monitoring:**
- Standard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP, SpO2, ETCO2, temperature)
- **Agent analyzer** for MAC/expired agent concentration (if using sevoflurane)
- Neuromuscular monitoring (TOF) if rocuronium used
- Consider BIS/depth monitoring (especially in elderly to minimize delirium risk)

---

## 5. Emergence

**10-15 Minutes Before End of Case:**
- Stop dexmedetomidine infusion (allow clearance before emergence)
- Continue ketamine infusion until skin closure complete
- Stop lidocaine infusion if used

**At Skin Closure:**
- Stop ketamine infusion
- Reduce volatile agent (to 0.5-0.7 MAC) or propofol infusion gradually (reduce by 50%)

**Before Extubation:**
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** (PONV prophylaxis)
- **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg IV** if TOF shows residual blockade (TOF ratio <0.9 or <4 twitches)
  - OR **4 mg/kg IV** for deep block (1-2 post-tetanic counts)

**Extubation Criteria:**
- Awake, following commands, eyes open
- Adequate spontaneous ventilation:
  - Tidal volume >5 mL/kg
  - Respiratory rate 10-20 breaths/min
  - SpO2 >92% on room air or minimal supplemental O2
- TOF ratio >0.9 (or >4 twitches if qualitative monitor)
- Protective airway reflexes present (cough, gag)
- Hemodynamically stable

**Expected:**
- Smooth extubation due to OFIA regimen
- Minimal coughing/bucking
- Alert and oriented in PACU (typically within 10-15 minutes)

## 6. Analgesia Plan

### Surgeon Periarticular Infiltration (Critical for This Pathway)
**Recommended technique:**
- **Volume:** 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2% (total 200-300 mg)
- **Optional additives:** Epinephrine 5 mcg/mL (1:200,000), ketorolac 30 mg
- **Timing:** Before or at closure for maximum effect
- **Sites:** Posterior capsule, periarticular tissues, subcutaneous layers
- **Documentation:** Total local anesthetic dose for LAST risk assessment

### Expected PACU Pain Scores
- **NRS 3–6/10** typical (higher than with blocks)
- Patient counseled preoperatively about higher early pain expectations
- Emphasize transient nature - improves with multimodal regimen

### Scheduled Analgesia
- **Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h** (max 4 g/day)
- **NSAID of choice:**
  - Celecoxib 200 mg PO q12h, OR
  - Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (max 60 mg/day, limit to 48-72 hours; check renal function), OR
  - Meloxicam 15 mg PO daily

### Rescue Analgesia (Stepwise)
1. **First-line:** Ketamine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg IV q10–15 min PRN (for NRS ≥4)
   - Max 3 doses (total ~0.3-0.45 mg/kg cumulative)
   - Monitor for dysphoria (rare at rescue doses)
   - Reassess pain after each dose

2. **Second-line (if ketamine inadequate after 3 doses):**
   - Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV q10-15 min PRN
   - Titrate carefully with reassessment after each dose
   - Use minimal effective total dose
   - Enhanced monitoring if elderly/frail/OSA for respiratory depression

### Non-Pharmacologic Measures
- Ice application to surgical site
- Limb elevation and positioning for comfort
- Reassurance and anxiety management

### Mobilization
- **Target:** Ambulation on POD 0 when pain controlled and patient alert (typically 4-6 hours post-op)
- May require more rescue analgesia than block pathway before mobilization
- Physical therapy evaluation when:
  - Alert and oriented
  - Pain controlled (NRS ≤4)
  - No orthostatic hypotension

### Infiltration Duration and Transition
- **Surgeon infiltration duration:** Typically 6-8 hours
- **Transition planning:** Ensure oral multimodal regimen established before infiltration offset
- **Anticipate higher analgesic needs** at 6-8 hours post-op
- Proactive pain management prevents escalation

## 7. Notes

### Clinical Advantages
- **Faster workflow** than block pathway (no block room time ~15 min saved)
- **No anticoagulation timing constraints**
- **Full motor strength** immediately available
- Still maintains **OFIA benefits:** reduced PONV (10-20% vs 30-40% with opioids), smooth emergence, low delirium risk

### Expected Differences from Block Pathway
- **Slightly higher pain** in first 12–24 hours (NRS 3-6 vs 0-3 with blocks)
- **Higher rescue medication use** in PACU (but still primarily ketamine, not opioids)
- **Surgeon infiltration critical** - coordinate technique and documentation

### Ideal Patient Population
- Anticoagulation preventing blocks (DOAC <72h, therapeutic LMWH <24h, prophylactic LMWH <12h)
- Patient refusal of needles/blocks
- Rapid workflow needed (add-on case, time constraints)
- Anatomical difficulties (severe obesity, prior surgery, scoliosis)

### Key Principles
- **Midazolam provides preoperative anxiolysis** and does not compromise opioid-free principles
- **Propofol (1.5-2 mg/kg) is the universal induction agent** for all pathways at UW
- **Sevoflurane and propofol TIVA are equally valid** maintenance choices:
  - Choose sevoflurane for standard workflow (most common at UW)
  - Choose propofol TIVA for high PONV risk or MH susceptibility
- **Higher ketamine doses** (0.4-0.5 mg/kg induction, 0.15-0.25 mg/kg/hr infusion) compensate for lack of regional analgesia
- **Lidocaine infusion optional** - consider for additional systemic analgesia (max 300 mg total)
- **Surgeon infiltration is not optional** - essential component of this pathway
- **Postoperative opioid rescue available** when clinically indicated - does not constitute pathway failure

### Contraindications to This Pathway
**Consider conventional opioid-based pathway if:**
- OFIA contraindications (acute psychosis, severe uncontrolled HTN >180 mmHg, high-degree AV block without pacemaker)
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30) - magnesium contraindicated
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) - lidocaine contraindicated
- Patient preference for conventional anesthesia after counseling

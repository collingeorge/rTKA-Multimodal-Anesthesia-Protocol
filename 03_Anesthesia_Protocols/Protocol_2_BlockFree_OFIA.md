## 1. Purpose and Clinical Context

### 1.1 Protocol Objectives

This protocol provides an **opioid-free intraoperative anesthesia (OFIA) pathway WITHOUT regional nerve blocks** for robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) that:

- **Maintains opioid-free intraoperative strategy** despite absence of regional blocks
- **Relies on systemic multimodal adjuncts** (dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine infusion, magnesium)
- **Utilizes surgeon periarticular infiltration** as primary regional analgesia component
- **Reduces PONV** through opioid-sparing and propofol-based strategies
- **Supports ERAS goals** including early mobilization (POD 0 within 4–8 hours)
- **Provides alternative when blocks contraindicated** or refused

### 1.2 Evidence Base

This protocol is informed by:
- ERAS Society Guidelines for Hip and Knee Arthroplasty (2019, 2024 updates)
- ASA/APSF perioperative safety communications (2024)
- SAMBA Consensus Statement on Opioid-Free Anesthesia (2020)
- Current peer-reviewed literature on systemic multimodal analgesia and lidocaine infusions

**Complete evidence grading and citations:** See `../../07_References_Evidence_2024.md`

### 1.3 When to Use This Protocol

**Default Pathway:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (blocks contraindicated) → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Patient refuses regional blocks after informed consent → **Protocol 2 is FIRST CHOICE**
- Body habitus prevents adequate ultrasound visualization for blocks
- Severe peripheral neuropathy affecting surgical extremity
- Prior surgery distorting anatomy (difficult block placement)
- Workflow constraints (time, equipment, personnel availability)
- Attending/institutional preference for block-free OFIA approach

**Position in Algorithm:**
- When blocks feasible and safe → **Protocol 1** (OFIA + ACB/IPACK) preferred
- When blocks NOT feasible but OFIA appropriate → **Protocol 2** (OFIA block-free) preferred over Protocol 3
- When OFIA adjuncts contraindicated → **Protocol 3** (opioid-inclusive)

### 1.4 Key Difference from Protocol 1

**Protocol 2 vs Protocol 1:**
- **No ACB/IPACK blocks** → Higher expected pain (NRS 2–5 vs 0–3)
- **Surgeon periarticular infiltration** is CRITICAL component
- **May include lidocaine infusion** as additional systemic adjunct
- **Faster workflow** (no block placement time)
- **More PACU rescue needs** anticipated and planned for
- **Still opioid-sparing** - zero intraoperative opioids

---

## 2. Patient Selection Criteria

### 2.1 Ideal Candidates

**Strongly preferred for:**
- Anticoagulation timing outside ASRA windows (most common indication)
- Patient refusal of regional blocks despite counseling
- High PONV risk (OFIA + propofol strategy still beneficial)
- OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3) - opioid-sparing still critical even without blocks
- Age >75 years when opioid minimization advantageous
- Body habitus preventing adequate block placement
- Prior surgery distorting regional anatomy

### 2.2 When Protocol 2 is CONTRAINDICATED (Use Protocol 3 Instead)

**Consider Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive) when:**
- **Multiple OFIA adjuncts contraindicated:**
  - Active psychosis (ketamine contraindicated)
  - High-grade AV block without pacemaker (dexmedetomidine contraindicated)
  - Severe hepatic impairment (lidocaine contraindicated)
  - CrCl <30 mL/min (magnesium contraindicated)
- **Hemodynamic instability** where adjuncts may worsen status
- **Severe cardiac disease** where dexmedetomidine/ketamine poorly tolerated
- **Attending judgment** that opioid-based approach safer for specific patient

**OFIA adjunct contraindications summary:**

| Adjunct | Absolute Contraindications | Relative Contraindications |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ketamine** | Active psychosis; severe uncontrolled HTN (SBP >180); acute globe injury | Frailty; hemodynamic instability; catecholamine-depleted physiology; age >85 |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | High-grade AV block without pacemaker; severe baseline bradycardia (HR <50) | Age >75; severe cardiac disease; baseline hypotension |
| **Lidocaine infusion** | Severe hepatic impairment; complete heart block; amide LA allergy; severe cardiac conduction disease | Hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B/C); seizure history |
| **Magnesium** | CrCl <30 mL/min; myasthenia gravis; complete heart block | Renal impairment (CrCl 30-50); risk of prolonged NMB |

### 2.3 Special Populations

**Elderly (>75 years):**
- Reduce all medication doses by 25–40%
- Midazolam: 0.5 mg maximum
- Propofol induction: 1–1.5 mg/kg
- Dexmedetomidine: 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum
- Ketamine: 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or omit
- Lidocaine: 1 mg/kg/hr maximum
- Enhanced emergence and PACU monitoring

**Frail patients:**
- Similar reductions as elderly
- Lower threshold to omit ketamine and lidocaine infusion
- Prioritize propofol TIVA over sevoflurane (better control)
- Extended PACU observation
- Lower threshold for monitored bed postoperatively

**OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3):**
- Protocol 2 is **appropriate** (opioid-sparing maintained)
- **BUT:** Anticipate higher rescue opioid needs in PACU than Protocol 1
- Ensure continuous pulse oximetry in PACU/floor
- Consider capnography in PACU
- Lower threshold for monitored bed

**Severe cardiac disease:**
- Careful hemodynamic management essential
- Phenylephrine infusion may be needed
- Consider arterial line
- Dexmedetomidine use with extreme caution (risk of bradycardia/hypotension)
- Lower threshold to omit dexmedetomidine and use opioid-based approach (Protocol 3)

**Chronic opioid use:**
- Protocol 2 still appropriate (continue home regimen)
- Anticipate **significantly higher** PACU rescue needs than Protocol 1
- May need Protocol 3 if very high tolerance (>120 MME/day) or if analgesia inadequate

---

## 3. Preoperative Phase

### 3.1 Preanesthetic Assessment

**Standard evaluation:**
- Complete history and physical examination
- Airway assessment (Mallampati, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck mobility)
- Review prior anesthesia records (complications, PONV, difficult airway, delirium)
- ASA physical status classification
- NPO status verification

**Risk factor identification:**
- **OSA:** STOP-Bang score
- **PONV risk:** Apfel score (female, non-smoker, hx PONV/motion sickness, postop opioids)
- **Frailty:** Clinical Frailty Scale or simple assessment (gait speed, grip strength)
- **Cognitive impairment:** Baseline mental status, prior delirium
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Functional capacity, recent stress testing, medication reconciliation
- **Renal function:** Creatinine clearance calculation (Cockcroft-Gault)
- **Hepatic function:** LFTs, synthetic function (important for lidocaine infusion safety)

**Chronic medication reconciliation:**
- **Opioids:** Document baseline regimen; continue morning dose
- **Anticoagulation:** Document why blocks not performed (see Section 3.2)
- **Cardiovascular medications:** Continue beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors (hold ARBs per institutional policy)
- **Psychiatric medications:** Continue SSRIs, antipsychotics; note ketamine interactions

### 3.2 Documentation of Block Omission

**Critical documentation requirement:**
In preoperative note, **explicitly document reason blocks NOT performed:**

| Reason | Documentation Example |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Anticoagulation timing** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, last dose 48 hours ago (ASRA requires ≥72h for deep peripheral blocks). Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Patient refusal** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Patient declined regional blocks after discussion of risks/benefits. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Anatomy/body habitus** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: BMI 52, unable to obtain adequate ultrasound visualization. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Prior surgery** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Prior femoral vascular surgery distorting anatomy. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)." |
| **Workflow constraints** | "ACB/IPACK omitted: Time constraints and OR availability. Proceeding with Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free) per attending decision." |

### 3.3 Surgeon Coordination for Periarticular Infiltration

> **CRITICAL:** Surgeon periarticular infiltration is the ONLY regional analgesia component in Protocol 2. This MUST be performed for adequate pain control.

**Pre-case discussion with surgeon:**
- [ ] Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular local anesthetic infiltration (LIA)
- [ ] Verify typical volume and concentration (e.g., 100–150 mL ropivacaine 0.2%)
- [ ] Ensure surgeon will document: drug(s), concentration(s), volume(s), total dose (mg)
- [ ] Plan for cumulative local anesthetic dose tracking

**CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT:**

The anesthesiologist must document in the anesthetic record:
- [ ] Surgeon infiltration confirmed: **YES / NO**
- [ ] If YES, agent: **[ropivacaine]**, concentration: **[0.2%]**, volume: **[___ mL]**, total dose: **[___ mg]**
- [ ] IV lidocaine infusion used: **YES / NO**
- [ ] If YES, rate: **[___ mg/kg/hr]**, duration: **[___ hours]**, total dose: **[___ mg]**
- [ ] **TOTAL LA BURDEN: [___ mg ropivacaine] + [___ mg lidocaine] = [___ mg total]**
- [ ] **Mg/kg calculation: [total mg] ÷ [body weight kg] = [___ mg/kg]**

**Safety threshold:** Most references cite ropivacaine toxicity threshold ~3 mg/kg (~210 mg for 70 kg). Protocol 2 typical total (200-300 mg ropivacaine + 100-150 mg lidocaine if infusion used) remains below toxic threshold for standard adult, but approaches limit in low body mass patients.

**Flag for review if:** Total LA burden >3.5 mg/kg or patient exhibits any concerning signs during/after administration.

**Typical surgeon periarticular infiltration:**
- **Ropivacaine 0.2%, 100–150 mL** injected into posterior capsule, medial/lateral soft tissues, periosteum
- **Total ropivacaine dose:** 200–300 mg (higher than Protocol 1 blocks, still below toxic threshold)
- **Expected duration:** 6–12 hours (shorter than ACB/IPACK)

### 3.4 Preoperative Medications (ERAS-Informed Multimodal Foundation)

| Medication | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg | PO | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg or hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 400 mg | PO | **Contraindications:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent MI/stroke, aspirin allergy<br>Alternative: Meloxicam 15 mg PO |
| **Dexamethasone** | 8–10 mg | IV | After IV access obtained; reduce to 4–6 mg if diabetic (monitor glucose) |

**Additional preoperative considerations:**

| Medication | Indication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Scopolamine patch** | High PONV risk only (Apfel ≥3) | 1.5 mg transdermal | Apply evening prior or ≥4 hours preop<br>**Contraindicated:** Narrow-angle glaucoma |
| **Midazolam** | Anxiolysis if needed | 0.5–2 mg IV | Reduce to 0.5 mg or avoid in age >75, frailty, OSA, cognitive impairment |
| **Gabapentinoids** | **NOT recommended** | — | Risk of sedation, delirium, respiratory depression outweighs benefit in modern multimodal protocols |
| **Home opioids** | Chronic opioid use | Baseline dose | Continue morning dose; do not escalate preoperatively |

**Documentation:**
- All preoperative medications given with timing
- Any medications held and rationale
- Allergies and adverse drug reactions verified

## 4. Induction

> **Induction achieves rapid, reliable loss of consciousness using propofol bolus.** Adjuncts are used to blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, NOT to replace hypnosis.
> Processed EEG indices must be interpreted in clinical context and **must not be used as the sole determinant of anesthetic depth**, particularly when ketamine, hypothermia, or neuromodulatory adjuncts are present.

### 4.1 Pre-Induction Checklist

**Verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Patient correctly identified, procedure verified (Time Out)
- [ ] ASA standard monitors applied and functioning
- [ ] IV access confirmed patent (consider 2nd IV for infusions)
- [ ] Airway equipment prepared and checked
- [ ] Anesthesia machine checkout complete
- [ ] Suction functioning
- [ ] Vasoactive medications drawn and labeled (phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine)
- [ ] Intubation equipment ready (video laryngoscope preferred)
- [ ] Difficult airway cart available
- [ ] Team briefing complete
- [ ] **Confirm surgeon will perform periarticular infiltration**

### 4.2 Induction Medications

**Primary Induction: Propofol**

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Expected Effect |
|-------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard adult** | **1.5–2 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 30–60 seconds | LOC in 30–45 seconds |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Frail** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 60–90 seconds | LOC in 45–60 seconds |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | **1–1.5 mg/kg IV** | Slow push over 90–120 seconds | LOC in 60–90 seconds; anticipate hypotension |
| **Hypovolemia suspected** | **1–1.2 mg/kg IV** | Very slow push | Aggressive vasopressor readiness |

**Critical Safety:**
- **Propofol causes dose-dependent hypotension**
- **Ensure immediate availability of vasoactive rescue:**
  - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (if HR adequate)
  - **Ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** (if HR <60)
  - **Epinephrine 5–10 mcg IV** (if severe hypotension)
- Have vasopressor drawn and ready BEFORE injecting propofol
- Anticipate hypotension in elderly, frail, severe cardiac disease, hypovolemia

#### Optional: Midazolam

**Only if needed for additional anxiolysis:**

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | 0–1 mg IV | Often omitted if already dosed preoperatively |
| **Elderly (>75)** | 0–0.5 mg IV | **Avoid if possible**; high delirium risk |
| **Frail/OSA** | **Avoid** | Respiratory depression risk |

**Decision point:** If midazolam 1–2 mg already given preoperatively → **omit at induction**

### 4.3 Optional Adjunct Boluses

> **Adjuncts blunt sympathetic response and support analgesia, but do NOT replace hypnosis.**

#### Ketamine (Optional Analgesic Adjunct)

**Indication:** Opioid-sparing analgesia, blunt intubation response, NMDA antagonism

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Standard adult** | **0.2–0.5 mg/kg IV** (14–35 mg for 70 kg) | **Higher end (0.5 mg/kg) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | High delirium risk |
| **Frail** | **0.2 mg/kg IV maximum** or **omit** | Hemodynamic fragility |
| **Hemodynamic instability** | **Omit** | Risk outweighs benefit |
| **Severe tachyarrhythmia risk** | **Omit** | Sympathetic stimulation undesirable |

**EEG monitoring caveat:**
- Ketamine may **increase BIS** and alter EEG-derived indices
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine administration
- Correlate with clinical context and raw EEG trends when available

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or unstable psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury or increased IOP
- Catecholamine-depleted physiology

#### Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Protocol 2 Specific Adjunct)

**Role:** Systemic analgesia, anti-inflammatory effects, opioid-sparing

> **Protocol 2 Note:** Lidocaine infusion is more commonly used in Protocol 2 (vs Protocol 1) as an additional systemic adjunct to compensate for lack of regional blocks.

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail/Hepatic Impairment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | **1–1.5 mg/kg/hr** | **1 mg/kg/hr maximum** | Start after induction once hemodynamically stable |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Use infusion pump for accuracy |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | Per institutional protocol |
| **Total Duration** | Typically <2–3 hours | <2 hours preferred | Institutional maximum often 3 hours |

**Contraindications:**
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** - absolute
- **Complete heart block without pacemaker** - absolute
- **Amide local anesthetic allergy** - absolute
- **Severe cardiac conduction disease** - relative (use with caution)

**Monitoring for CNS Toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, agitation, seizures
- **Action:** Stop infusion immediately if any signs/symptoms; prepare for LAST management

**Why Lidocaine Infusion in Protocol 2:**
- Compensates for lack of regional blocks
- Evidence for reduced opioid consumption and improved recovery
- Synergistic with other OFIA adjuncts
- Generally well-tolerated when dosed conservatively

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions do NOT use lidocaine infusions
- Verify local policy and formulary availability
- May require specific credentialing or approval

#### Magnesium Sulfate Maintenance (If Loaded)

**Role:** NMDA antagonism, mild analgesia

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Maintenance Rate** | 8–10 mg/kg/hr if loading dose given |
| **Duration** | Continue until skin closure |
| **Warning** | Potentiates neuromuscular blockade; anticipate prolonged paralysis |

**Monitoring:**
- TOF monitoring essential (see Section 8.3)
- May require higher sugammadex dose for reversal

---

## 5. Maintenance Anesthesia

> **Maintenance ensures continuous unconsciousness while OFIA adjuncts provide analgesia and sympatholysis.**
> Processed EEG indices must be interpreted in clinical context and **must not be used as the sole determinant of anesthetic depth**, particularly when ketamine, hypothermia, or neuromodulatory adjuncts are present.

### 5.1 Critical Requirement: Hypnotic Continuity

**Every patient requires continuous hypnosis maintained by propofol and/or sevoflurane.**

> **Cross-Reference:** See [Protocol Comparison Table - Maintenance Anesthesia](Protocol_Comparison_Table.md#maintenance-anesthesia) for complete options and detailed safety profiles.

**Choose ONE of the following hypnotic strategies:**

#### Option A: Propofol TIVA (Preferred for Protocol 2)

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **75–125 mcg/kg/min** (titrate to depth monitors) | Antiemetic properties; precise control; MH-safe |
| **Monitoring** | Consider processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in elderly/frail | Reduces risk of excessive depth |
| **Default Pathway** | High PONV risk; MH susceptibility; institutional preference | Best for Protocol 2 goals |

#### Option B: Sevoflurane

| Component | Details | Advantages |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Dosing** | **0.7–1 MAC** (age-adjusted; see table below) | Familiar; easy titration; rapid offset |
| **Monitoring** | End-tidal agent monitoring | Standard volatile technique |
| **Default Pathway** | Standard workflow; not high PONV risk; volatile-capable machine | Widely available |

**Age-Adjusted MAC Reduction for Sevoflurane:**

| Age Range | MAC Reduction | Effective MAC Range |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Age 65–75** | Reduce by ~20% | 0.56–0.8 MAC |
| **Age 75–85** | Reduce by ~30–40% | 0.42–0.7 MAC |
| **Age >85** | Reduce by ~40–50% | 0.35–0.6 MAC |

#### Option C: Balanced (Propofol + Sevoflurane)

| Component | Details | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Dosing** | Propofol 50–75 mcg/kg/min + Sevoflurane 0.3–0.5 MAC | May reduce total dose of each |
| **Complexity** | More challenging titration | Requires experience with hybrid technique |
| **Default Pathway** | Institutional preference or specific clinical scenarios | Not routine for Protocol 2 |

---

### 5.2 OFIA Adjuncts (Supplement Hypnosis - Do NOT Replace)

> **Critical Understanding:**
> - Adjuncts provide **analgesia and sympatholysis**
> - Adjuncts do **NOT** provide surgical hypnosis
> - Adjuncts allow **dose reduction** of propofol/sevoflurane while maintaining depth
> - **Do not rely on adjuncts alone for unconsciousness**

#### Dexmedetomidine Infusion

**Role:** Sedation, sympatholysis, opioid-sparing analgesia (NOT primary hypnosis)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr | 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr maximum | **Higher end (0.7 mcg/kg/hr) may be used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks; NO bolus loading |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Titrate to effect |
| **Stop Time** | 10–15 min before case end | 10–15 min before case end | Prevents prolonged sedation |

**Dosing Strategy:**
- **Default range: 0.2–0.4 mcg/kg/hr** for most patients
- **Higher range (0.5–0.7 mcg/kg/hr)** may be used in Protocol 2 to compensate for lack of blocks, BUT:
  - **Exclude if:** Baseline HR <60, any AV conduction disease, age >75, or severe cardiac disease
  - **Monitor closely:** HR/BP every 5 minutes when using higher rates
  - **Taper early:** Stop 15–20 minutes before case end when using higher rates

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Continuous HR/BP monitoring
- **Stop if HR <50 with symptoms** or **<45 regardless of symptoms**
- **Reduce or stop** if hypotension (MAP <60) unresponsive to fluids/vasopressors

**Bradycardia Management:**
1. **First:** Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion
2. **Then:** Glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV if symptomatic
3. **Consider:** Discontinuing dexmedetomidine if recurrent

**Contraindications:**
- High-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Severe baseline bradycardia (HR <50 at baseline)
- Severe baseline hypotension (MAP <60 mmHg)

#### Ketamine Infusion (Optional)

**Role:** Analgesia, dissociation, NMDA antagonism (NOT reliable unconsciousness)

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | 0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr | 0.1 mg/kg/hr maximum or **omit** | **Higher end (0.25 mg/kg/hr) more commonly used in Protocol 2** due to lack of blocks |
| **Start Time** | After induction | After induction | If bolus given at induction |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | May omit entirely in high-risk |

**BIS Monitoring Caveat:**
- Ketamine **dissociates cortical activity** and may increase BIS
- Do **NOT** titrate hypnotic depth solely to BIS after ketamine
- Correlate with clinical context (movement, autonomic signs, raw EEG trends)

**Use Caution or Omit When:**
- Hemodynamic instability or catecholamine-depleted physiology
- Significant tachyarrhythmia risk
- Frailty or high delirium-risk phenotype
- Age >85 years

**Contraindications:**
- Active psychosis or severe psychiatric disease
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
- Acute globe injury

#### Lidocaine Infusion (Optional - Protocol 2 Specific Adjunct)

**Role:** Systemic analgesia, anti-inflammatory effects, opioid-sparing

| Parameter | Standard Adult | Elderly/Frail/Hepatic Impairment | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Dosing** | **1–1.5 mg/kg/hr** | **1 mg/kg/hr maximum** | Start after induction once hemodynamically stable |
| **Start Time** | After intubation | After intubation | Use infusion pump for accuracy |
| **Stop Time** | At skin closure | At skin closure | Per institutional protocol |
| **Total Duration** | Typically <2–3 hours | <2 hours preferred | Institutional maximum often 3 hours |

**Contraindications:**
- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)** - absolute
- **Complete heart block without pacemaker** - absolute
- **Amide local anesthetic allergy** - absolute
- **Severe cardiac conduction disease** - relative (use with caution)

**Monitoring for CNS Toxicity:**
- Early signs: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness
- Progressive: Confusion, slurred speech, agitation, seizures
- **Action:** Stop infusion immediately if any signs/symptoms; prepare for LAST management

**Why Lidocaine Infusion in Protocol 2:**
- Compensates for lack of regional blocks
- Evidence for reduced opioid consumption and improved recovery
- Synergistic with other OFIA adjuncts
- Generally well-tolerated when dosed conservatively

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions do NOT use lidocaine infusions
- Verify local policy and formulary availability
- May require specific credentialing or approval

---

## 6. Emergence

> **Emergence is a high-risk phase requiring intentional planning and controlled execution.**

### 6.1 Pre-Emergence Planning (10–15 Minutes Before Anticipated End)

**Goal:** Smooth, controlled emergence without prolonged sedation or delayed extubation.

**Actions:**

| Time Point | Action | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **15 min before end** | Taper or stop dexmedetomidine | Prevent prolonged sedation |
| **15 min before end** | Reduce propofol toward emergence dosing (50–75 mcg/kg/min) | Begin lightening depth |
| **10 min before end** | Plan ketamine discontinuation (if used) | Minimize dissociative effects |
| **10 min before end** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if used) | Per institutional protocol |
| **10 min before end** | Verify TOF monitor functioning and ready | Essential for reversal timing |
| **At skin closure** | Stop ketamine infusion | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop dexmedetomidine (if not already) | — |
| **At skin closure** | Stop lidocaine infusion (if not already) | — |

**Communication:**
- Inform surgical team of anticipated emergence timing
- Confirm no additional procedures planned
- Verify dressing application plan

### 6.2 Hypnotic Reduction

**Propofol TIVA:**
- Taper to 25–50 mcg/kg/min at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Sevoflurane:**
- Reduce to 0.4–0.6 MAC at skin closure
- Discontinue after dressing applied or when spontaneous ventilation adequate

**Do NOT:**
- Abruptly stop hypnotic before patient ready to emerge
- Rely on adjuncts alone (dexmedetomidine is NOT sufficient for unconsciousness)

### 6.3 Reversal and PONV Prophylaxis

#### Ondansetron

**Timing:** Before emergence or at skin closure

| Patient Population | Dose | Notes |
|-------------------|------|-------|
| **All patients** | **4 mg IV** | If not already given preoperatively |
| **High PONV risk** | 4 mg IV (in addition to scopolamine patch) | May repeat 4 mg in PACU if needed |

#### Neuromuscular Reversal

> **Critical:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 is **MANDATORY** before extubation. Residual neuromuscular blockade is a patient safety risk.

**Sugammadex Dosing:**

> **Renal safety:** **Sugammadex is not recommended in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), including dialysis**, due to prolonged exposure and limited safety data. Use only in accordance with institutional policy and attending anesthesiologist judgment.

| TOF Status | Dose | Wait Time | Expected Outcome |
|------------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **TOF count ≥2, ratio <0.9** | **Sugammadex 2 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF ratio ≥0.9 |
| **Deep block (TOF 1–2)** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | TOF count ≥2, then reassess |
| **Post-tetanic count only** | **Sugammadex 4 mg/kg** | 2–3 minutes | May require additional time |

**After sugammadex administration:**
1. Wait 2–3 minutes
2. Reassess TOF ratio
3. **Confirm TOF ratio ≥0.9** before proceeding to extubation
4. If TOF <0.9 → wait longer or consider additional sugammadex (consult attending)

**Special Considerations:**
- **Magnesium potentiates NMB:** May need higher sugammadex dose or longer wait time
- **Obesity:** Dose sugammadex to **total body weight** (not IBW)
- **Mild–moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 and <80 mL/min):**
  - No routine dose adjustment required
  - Clearance is prolonged; monitor closely

- **Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min, including dialysis):**
  - **Sugammadex is not recommended**
  - Follow institutional reversal pathway and attending decision-making

### 6.4 Extubation Criteria

**ALL of the following must be met before extubation:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Target |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Consciousness** | Patient opens eyes to command, squeezes hand | Awake and follows commands |
| **Respiratory Rate** | Count breaths over 15 seconds | 10–20 breaths/min |
| **Tidal Volume** | Observe chest rise or measure with spirometry | ≥5 mL/kg (≥350 mL for 70 kg) |
| **Oxygenation** | Pulse oximetry | SpO₂ ≥95% on 100% O₂ (≥92% if chronic lung disease) |
| **Neuromuscular Function** | TOF monitoring | **TOF ratio ≥0.9 (mandatory)** |
| **Hemodynamics** | Continuous monitoring | MAP ≥65 mmHg or near baseline |
| **No Active Bleeding** | Surgical team confirmation | No ongoing hemorrhage or concern |

**Additional Clinical Assessment:**
- Sustained head lift for 5 seconds
- Sustained grip strength bilaterally
- Sustained tongue protrusion
- No fasciculations
- Adequate cough and gag reflex

**Do NOT Extubate If:**
- Any somnolence remains
- TOF <0.9
- Inadequate respiratory effort (RR <10, TV <5 mL/kg)
- Hemodynamic instability
- Active bleeding or surgical concern
- Patient confused or combative

**Special Populations:**

| Population | Additional Considerations |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Elderly (>75)** | Lower threshold to delay extubation; ensure fully awake |
| **Frail** | Extended observation before extubation decision |
| **OSA** | More stringent criteria; ensure robust ventilation |
| **Cardiac Disease** | Ensure hemodynamic stability before airway manipulation |

**Assessment and Management:**

**Pain Assessment:**
- Assess pain level using NRS (0-10 scale) as soon as patient responsive
- **If NRS ≥4:** Consider IV acetaminophen 1g if not already given; prepare for opioid rescue if NRS ≥7

**Delirium Prevention Strategies (Start Preoperatively):**

Non-pharmacologic interventions reduce delirium incidence and should be implemented throughout perioperative period:

**Preoperative:**
- Identify high-risk patients (age >75, baseline cognitive impairment, frailty, depression, alcohol use)
- Ensure corrective lenses and hearing aids available postoperatively
- Family education on expected recovery and their role in reorientation

**Intraoperative:**
- Minimize benzodiazepine use (already emphasized in Protocol 2)
- Avoid excessive anesthetic depth (BIS 40–60 when using processed EEG)
- Maintain normothermia (>36°C)
- Avoid severe hypotension (MAP >65 mmHg)
- Minimize blood loss and transfusion

**Postoperative (PACU and Floor):**
- Early mobilization (target POD 0 within 4–8 hours)
- Minimize sleep disruption (cluster care activities)
- Ensure glasses, hearing aids, dentures in place
- Frequent reorientation (clocks, calendars, family presence)
- Adequate pain control WITHOUT over-sedation
- Avoid urinary catheters when possible (remove early if placed)
- Maintain regular bowel function

**Emergence Delirium Recognition and Management:**

Emergence delirium presents as agitation, confusion, disorientation, or combativeness in the immediate post-extubation period. It is more common in elderly, frail, OSA, and patients with baseline cognitive impairment.

**Management Algorithm:**

1. **FIRST: Rule out physiologic causes**
   - [ ] **Hypoxemia:** Check SpO₂; ensure ≥92%; increase O₂ as needed
   - [ ] **Hypercarbia:** Consider capnography; ensure adequate ventilation
   - [ ] **Hypotension:** Check MAP; ensure ≥65 mmHg; treat if low
   - [ ] **Hypoglycemia:** Check fingerstick glucose if diabetic or prolonged NPO
   - [ ] **Pain:** Assess NRS; treat pain FIRST before considering sedation

2. **SECOND: Environmental and behavioral de-escalation**
   - Calm, reassuring voice
   - Reorient patient ("Surgery is over, you're in the recovery room")
   - Minimize stimulation (lights, noise, unnecessary procedures)
   - Family presence if institutional policy allows

3. **THIRD: Medication management (if behavioral measures inadequate)**

**Standard Adult (no frailty/elderly/OSA):**
- Consider **low-dose propofol 10–20 mg IV** (short-acting, minimal respiratory depression)
- OR **dexmedetomidine bolus 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 min** followed by low-rate infusion (if already familiar to patient from intraoperative use)

**Elderly/Frail/OSA/Cognitive Impairment:**
- **AVOID benzodiazepines** (high delirium risk, respiratory depression, prolonged sedation)
- **First-line:** Low-dose **haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV** (where institutionally permitted)
- **Alternative:** Low-dose **propofol 10 mg IV** (reassess q3–5min)
- **Last resort:** If agitation severe and refractory, consult attending for decision-making

**Institutional Variability:**
- Some institutions prefer haloperidol or droperidol for agitation
- Some institutions have specific delirium protocols
- Verify local policy before proceeding

**Critical Note:** Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, midazolam) should be **avoided or minimized** in elderly, frail, and OSA patients due to significant risk of worsening delirium, respiratory depression, and prolonged recovery.

## 7. Postoperative Pain Management

> **Expected pain profile WITHOUT regional blocks:** NRS 2–5 is typical, representing good but not excellent analgesia. This is HIGHER than Protocol 1 and requires robust multimodal foundation plus planned rescue pathway.

### 7.1 Expected Pain Profile

**With surgeon periarticular infiltration (NO nerve blocks):**

| Time Period | Expected NRS | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **0–4 hours** | 2–4 | Good analgesia from infiltration; some rescue needs |
| **4–8 hours** | 3–5 | Infiltration wearing off; transition to oral regimen |
| **8–12 hours** | 3–5 | Oral multimodal regimen primary |
| **12–24 hours** | 3–5 | Continued multimodal regimen |

**If NRS ≥6 at any time:**
- Reassess adequacy of surgeon infiltration
- Rule out surgical complications (hematoma, compartment syndrome)
- Implement rescue analgesia pathway (see Section 7.3)

### 7.2 Scheduled Multimodal Analgesia (Foundation for All Patients)

**Start immediately in PACU and continue on floor:**

| Medication | Dose | Route | Frequency | Maximum Daily | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Acetaminophen** | 650–1000 mg | PO/IV | Every 6 hours | 3 g/day (hepatic impairment)<br>4 g/day (normal liver) | Reduce to 650 mg if <50 kg |
| **Celecoxib** | 200 mg | PO | Every 12 hours | 400 mg/day | **First-line NSAID** (selective COX-2)<br>**Avoid:** CrCl <30, active GI bleed, recent CV event |
| **Ketorolac** (alternative) | 15 mg | IV | Every 6 hours | 60 mg/day; max 5 days | **Use with caution:** Age >65, CrCl <50, bleeding risk<br>Consider avoiding in elderly |
| **Meloxicam** (alternative) | 7.5–15 mg | PO | Once daily | 15 mg/day | Alternative NSAID if celecoxib not available |

**Gabapentinoid Use (Institutional Variability):**

Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) are **NOT routinely recommended** in Protocol 2 due to:
- Increased sedation and delirium risk
- Respiratory depression concerns, especially in OSA
- Limited benefit in opioid-naïve patients within modern multimodal protocols

**Exception:** Some institutions use gabapentinoids for **select chronic pain phenotypes** (e.g., neuropathic pain, chronic opioid users). If institutional protocol includes gabapentinoids:
- **Explicitly exclude:** Frail, elderly (>75), OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3), cognitive impairment, or baseline sedation
- **Dosing:** Gabapentin 100–300 mg PO (NOT 600–900 mg commonly cited in older literature)
- **Timing:** Single preoperative dose only; NOT continued postoperatively in routine cases
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced sedation and respiratory monitoring required

**Default recommendation:** Omit gabapentinoids from Protocol 2 unless compelling institutional data supports benefit in your specific patient population.

**NSAID Decision-Making:**
- **Strong benefit when safe:** Reduce opioid requirement by 30–50%
- **High caution required in:**
  - Elderly (>75 years)
  - Renal impairment (CrCl <50)
  - Cardiovascular disease (recent MI/stroke, heart failure)
  - Concurrent anticoagulation (bleeding risk)
  - Gastrointestinal disease (ulcer, bleeding history)
- **Prefer selective COX-2 (celecoxib)** over ketorolac in higher-risk patients
- **Duration:** Limit to 5 days maximum; reassess daily

**Gabapentinoids:**
- **NOT routinely recommended** in Protocol 2
- Risk of sedation, delirium, and respiratory depression outweighs benefit
- May be considered in select institutional protocols for chronic pain phenotypes, but requires explicit exclusion of frail/elderly/OSA/cognitive impairment patients

### 7.3 Rescue Analgesia (Conservative Stepwise Approach)

> **Protocol 2 Expectation:** More rescue analgesia will be needed compared to Protocol 1 due to absence of regional blocks. This is ANTICIPATED and PLANNED FOR.

#### Step 1: Reassess and Optimize

**Before administering rescue medications:**
- [ ] Verify scheduled multimodal medications given on time
- [ ] Ensure surgeon periarticular infiltration was performed (verify in operative note)
- [ ] Reposition patient for comfort
- [ ] Apply ice to surgical site (if not contraindicated)
- [ ] Assess for surgical complications (see Section 9.2)

#### Step 2: Ketamine Rescue (If Institutional Protocol Allows)

**Indication:** Moderate to severe pain (NRS 5–7) unresponsive to multimodal foundation

| Patient Population | Dose | Administration | Maximum |
|-------------------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard adult** | **10–20 mg IV** (0.1–0.15 mg/kg) | Slow push over 1–2 minutes | ~3 doses per reassessment period |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **7–10 mg IV** (0.1 mg/kg) | Slow push over 2 minutes | 2 doses maximum |
| **Frail** | **7–10 mg IV** or **omit** | Slow push over 2 minutes | Consider opioid alternative |

**Reassessment Interval:** 10–15 minutes after each dose

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Blood pressure every 5 minutes for first 15 minutes after dose
- Assess for dissociative effects (patients may appear "zoned out" - reassure)

**Institutional Variability:**
- Ketamine as PACU rescue is **not universally adopted**
- Verify local policy before implementation
- Some institutions prefer opioid rescue as first-line

#### Step 3: Opioid Rescue (Conservative Incremental Dosing)

**Indication:** Severe pain (NRS ≥7) unresponsive to multimodal + ketamine, OR ketamine contraindicated/unavailable

**Protocol 2 Reality:** Opioid rescue requirements are HIGHER than Protocol 1 due to absence of regional blocks. This does not represent pathway failure.

| Patient Population | First Dose | Reassessment Interval | Subsequent Doses |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Standard adult (opioid-naïve)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | 0.2–0.4 mg IV |
| **Elderly (>75)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **Frail** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Hydromorphone 0.2 mg IV** | 20–30 minutes | 0.2 mg IV; longer intervals; enhanced monitoring |
| **Chronic opioid use** | **Hydromorphone 0.4–0.8 mg IV** | 15–20 minutes | Titrate to effect; anticipate tolerance |

**Phenotype-Specific Considerations:**

| Population | Interval Adjustment | Additional Precautions |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Frail** | **Extend to 25–30 min** between doses | Use lowest effective dose; consider stopping at 2–3 total doses |
| **Elderly (>80)** | **Extend to 25–30 min** between doses | Enhanced sedation monitoring; lower threshold for capnography |
| **OSA (STOP-Bang ≥3)** | **Extend to 25–30 min** between doses | Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry; strongly consider capnography |
| **Severe cardiac disease** | **Standard intervals OK** but **lower doses** | Close hemodynamic monitoring; arterial line if concern for instability |
| **Chronic opioid (>120 MME/day)** | **May shorten to 10–15 min** with higher doses | Anticipate tolerance; early pain service consultation if inadequate |

**General Principle:** When in doubt, extend the interval and use the lowest effective dose. Respiratory safety > speed of titration.

**Alternative: Fentanyl (if institutional preference):**
- **Standard adult:** Fentanyl 25–50 mcg IV q5–10min
- **Elderly/frail:** Fentanyl 12.5–25 mcg IV q10–15min
- **Advantage:** Shorter duration; disadvantage: more frequent redosing

**Enhanced Monitoring Requirements:**
- **Mandatory continuous pulse oximetry** until stable and pain controlled
- **Consider capnography** for OSA, elderly, opioid-naïve, or high cumulative opioid dose
- **Sedation assessment** every 10–15 minutes using standardized scale (RASS, Pasero)
- **Respiratory rate** every 10–15 minutes; alert if <10 breaths/min

**Naloxone Availability:**
- **Immediately available** at bedside (0.4 mg ampules)
- Dosing if respiratory depression: **0.04–0.08 mg IV** titrated (avoid full reversal/withdrawal)
- May repeat every 2–3 minutes until respiratory rate ≥10 and adequate TV

**Escalation Criteria:**
- If NRS remains ≥6 despite maximal multimodal + ketamine + opioids → **Consult attending anesthesiologist**
- Consider alternative strategies:
  - Postoperative ACB catheter placement (if now feasible)
  - Regional anesthesia consultation
  - Pain medicine consultation
- **Evaluate for surgical complications** (see Section 9.2)

### 7.4 Oral Opioid Transition (If Needed)

**Protocol 2 patients often require SHORT-TERM oral opioids:**

| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Duration | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Oxycodone** | 5 mg PO | q4–6h PRN | 3–5 days maximum | **First-line oral opioid**<br>Continue scheduled multimodal |
| **Hydrocodone/APAP** | 5/325 mg PO | q4–6h PRN | 3–5 days maximum | Alternative if oxycodone unavailable |

**Patient Counseling:**
- Take scheduled non-opioid medications FIRST (acetaminophen, celecoxib)
- Use opioids only for breakthrough pain (NRS ≥6)
- Constipation prophylaxis (senna, docusate)
- Safe storage and disposal of unused medications
- Do not drive or operate machinery while taking opioids
- Expected duration: 3–5 days, then transition to non-opioid regimen

### 7.5 Mobilization and Physical Therapy

**Goal:** POD 0 ambulation within 4–8 hours post-op (slightly longer than Protocol 1 due to pain management needs)

**Mobilization Protocol:**
- **Phase 1 (2–4 hours):** Sit at edge of bed with assistance
- **Phase 2 (4–6 hours):** Stand with walker and PT assistance
- **Phase 3 (6–8 hours):** Ambulate 10–20 feet with walker
- **Progression:** As tolerated per PT assessment and pain control

**Barriers to Early Mobilization:**
- Inadequate pain control (NRS >6)
- Excessive sedation (from opioids or adjuncts)
- PONV
- Hypotension or dizziness

### 7.6 Local Anesthetic Burden and LAST Preparedness

> **Critical Safety Note:** Even without regional nerve blocks, Protocol 2 involves significant local anesthetic exposure through surgeon periarticular infiltration and (optionally) IV lidocaine infusion. LAST risk remains present.

**Cumulative Local Anesthetic Accounting:**

| Source | Typical Dose | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Surgeon periarticular infiltration** | 200–300 mg ropivacaine | Most significant LA source in Protocol 2 |
| **IV lidocaine infusion** (if used) | ~100–150 mg/hr | Typical 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr x 2 hours |
| **Total potential exposure** | 400–600 mg | Below toxic threshold for most adults, but approach with caution |

**High-Risk Scenarios for LAST:**
- **Low body mass** (<50 kg): Mg/kg thresholds approached more quickly
- **Frail/elderly:** Reduced hepatic clearance, lower protein binding
- **Hepatic impairment:** Reduced metabolism of amide local anesthetics
- **Inadvertent intravascular injection** during infiltration (surgeon technique-dependent)
- **Stacking** multiple amide sources without awareness (infiltration + IV lidocaine + any topical)

**LAST Preparedness Requirements:**
- [ ] **20% lipid emulsion immediately available** in OR and PACU (same as Protocol 1)
- [ ] **LAST treatment protocol** posted and visible
- [ ] **Staff trained** in LAST recognition and management
- [ ] **Cumulative LA dose documented** in anesthetic record (infiltration + IV lidocaine if used)

**LAST Recognition (Early Signs):**
- CNS: Perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, confusion, seizures
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia → bradycardia → arrhythmias → cardiovascular collapse

**LAST Treatment Algorithm:**
1. **Stop any ongoing LA administration** (stop IV lidocaine infusion if running)
2. **Call for help** (announce "Local anesthetic toxicity")
3. **Airway management:** 100% O₂, support ventilation
4. **Seizure control:** Benzodiazepines (midazolam 1–2 mg IV) or propofol if needed
5. **Lipid emulsion therapy:**
   - Initial bolus: 1.5 mL/kg (~100 mL for 70 kg) over 1 minute
   - Infusion: 0.25 mL/kg/min for 10 minutes
   - Repeat bolus if persistent cardiovascular collapse
6. **ACLS with modifications:** Small doses epi (≤1 mcg/kg), avoid vasopressin, avoid calcium channel blockers, prolonged resuscitation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Total ropivacaine dose from surgeon infiltration (mg)
- IV lidocaine total dose if used (mg)
- Combined mg/kg calculation
- Any signs/symptoms concerning for LAST

**Clinical Pearl:** LAST can occur even with "safe" total doses if rapid vascular absorption occurs. Maintain high index of suspicion throughout case and into PACU period.

---

## 8. Safety Monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring in PACU:**
- **Vital signs:** Continuous monitoring of BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, and temperature
- **Level of Consciousness:** RASS score every 15 minutes until stable
- **Pain Level:** Document NRS (numeric rating scale) for pain at regular intervals (every 15 minutes initially)
- **Oxygenation:** Continuous pulse oximetry; consider CO2 monitoring for OSA or high-risk patients
- **Temperature:** Monitor body temperature to avoid hypothermia, especially if significant fluid shifts or long operative time

### 8.1 Neuromuscular Blockade Reversal Monitoring
- **TOF (Train-of-Four) Monitoring:** TOF ratio ≥0.9 must be achieved before extubation.  
  - **Goal:** Ensure no residual neuromuscular blockade remains to prevent hypoventilation post-extubation.
  - **TOF 0–1:** Sugammadex 2–4 mg/kg based on depth of block.
  - **Post-reversal:** Confirm normal hand strength, cough, and head lift for extubation readiness.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Inadequate analgesia (NRS >4)** | Inadequate periarticular infiltration, inadequate opioid-sparing regimen | Administer additional non-opioid analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen), consider low-dose opioid (morphine 1–2 mg IV) |
| **Hypotension (MAP <60 mmHg)** | Propofol bolus, hypovolemia, insufficient vasoactive support | Administer IV fluids (500 mL bolus), initiate phenylephrine or ephedrine as needed, reduce propofol infusion |
| **Bradycardia (HR <50 bpm)** | Dexmedetomidine, inadequate sympathetic tone | Reduce or stop dexmedetomidine infusion, administer atropine 0.5 mg IV, assess for other causes of bradycardia |
| **Emergence delirium (confusion, agitation)** | Rapid emergence, residual anesthetic agents, hypoxia | Ensure adequate O₂ supplementation, allow time for emergence, administer benzodiazepines if needed (lorazepam 0.5 mg IV) |
| **Oxygen desaturation (SpO₂ <90%)** | OSA, airway obstruction, respiratory depression | Reposition patient, provide CPAP if OSA suspected, administer supplemental oxygen, consider CPAP or BiPAP for severe cases |

### 9.2 Early Warning Signs for Severe Complications
- **Hypoxia (SpO₂ <85%):** Immediate action required—administer high-flow O₂, reposition patient, assess for airway obstruction, prepare for possible re-intubation
- **Severe hypotension (MAP <50 mmHg):** Initiate vasoactive medications (phenylephrine or ephedrine), bolus IV fluids
- **Severe bradycardia (HR <40):** Administer atropine, stop dexmedetomidine, consider pacing if necessary

---

## 10. Clinical Pearls

### 10.1 Regional Analgesia and Block-Free Considerations

1. **Surgeon periarticular infiltration is critical:**  
   Without regional blocks, periarticular infiltration with 100-150 mL of **ropivacaine 0.2%** is essential for maintaining postoperative analgesia. Ensure surgeon documentation of infiltration volume, concentration, and total dose to track systemic local anesthetic (LA) burden.

2. **Expect higher postoperative pain levels (NRS 2–5):**  
   Without regional blocks, **pain control is more challenging**, and patients may report slightly higher pain scores compared to **Protocol 1**. Ensure **multimodal analgesia** is optimized, including adjuncts like **ketamine, lidocaine infusion**, and **NSAIDs**. If pain levels exceed NRS 4, reassess analgesic strategy promptly.

3. **Lidocaine infusion can bridge the gap:**  
   **Lidocaine infusions** in Protocol 2 provide valuable systemic analgesia when regional blocks are omitted. **Start lidocaine infusion after induction** to help reduce opioid consumption and improve pain control during surgery. **Monitor for CNS toxicity** signs like dizziness, tinnitus, and confusion, and have LAST treatment protocols ready.

4. **Ketamine’s role in pain and sympatholysis:**  
   Use **ketamine infusions (0.1–0.25 mg/kg/hr)** to **blunt the sympathetic response** and provide **opioid-sparing analgesia**. Ketamine also helps to prevent **peripheral sensitization**. Be cautious in elderly, frail patients, or those with **hemodynamic instability** due to its sympathomimetic effects.

5. **No reliance on BIS alone for anesthetic depth:**  
   While **processed EEG** monitoring (e.g., BIS) is useful, **do not rely solely on BIS** when ketamine or other adjuncts are used. Always correlate BIS with **clinical signs** (e.g., movement, eye opening) and **raw EEG** if available. This ensures a more accurate assessment of depth of anesthesia.

6. **Pain management at emergence:**  
   In Protocol 2, **pain management in the PACU** may be less predictable compared to Protocol 1, due to the absence of regional blocks. **Use non-opioid strategies** as first-line treatment, and be ready to administer **low-dose opioids** (e.g., morphine 1-2 mg IV) if pain exceeds NRS 4. Be mindful of **PONV risks** and incorporate multimodal antiemetic strategies.

7. **Avoid over-sedation in elderly or frail patients:**  
   Adjust dosing for **elderly** and **frail** patients to minimize risks of over-sedation. **Use lower doses of adjuncts** (e.g., **dexmedetomidine**, **ketamine**) and avoid high initial doses to reduce the risk of delirium, bradycardia, and hypotension. **Frequent re-assessment** of sedation depth is crucial.

8. **Avoid excessive dosing of dexmedetomidine:**  
   In **Protocol 2**, dexmedetomidine is often used as a sedative and sympatholytic adjunct. However, **avoid high bolus doses** as they can lead to **bradycardia** and **hypotension**, particularly in elderly or frail patients. A continuous infusion is preferred over bolus administration.

9. **Protocol 2 is an alternative when regional blocks are not possible:**  
   If **regional blocks** are contraindicated (e.g., **anticoagulation timing**, **patient refusal**, **anatomical issues**), **Protocol 2 (OFIA block-free)** offers an effective **opioid-free** alternative. It maintains the goal of **opioid minimization**, though with **higher expected pain levels** and a greater need for postoperative pain management.

10. **Monitor for signs of LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity):**  
    **LAST** is always a concern with any **local anesthetic** use, including **surgeon periarticular infiltration**. Ensure **lipid emulsion** is immediately available and that **cumulative local anesthetic doses** are tracked to avoid toxicity. Be aware of early signs such as **perioral numbness**, **tinnitus**, and **dizziness**.

11. **Increased need for PACU rescue analgesia in Protocol 2:**  
    Without regional blocks, patients undergoing **Protocol 2** will likely need more **rescue analgesia** in the **PACU**. Be prepared with **opioid-sparing options** like **ketamine**, **magnesium**, and **lidocaine** for breakthrough pain, but be ready to administer **low-dose opioids** if needed.

12. **Protocol 2 provides fast workflow with no block setup required:**  
    One of the **main advantages** of Protocol 2 is its **faster workflow**, as there is no need for **block placement**. This is particularly beneficial when **time constraints** or **staffing limitations** are present, or when **blocks** are contraindicated or refused by the patient.

13. **Key benefit: no need for regional block contraindication workarounds:**  
    For patients who are not candidates for regional blocks, **Protocol 2** is a strong alternative that does not require complex workarounds. This streamlines the anesthetic plan and ensures that **opioid-free** anesthesia is maintained.

## Appendix B: Patient Information Sheet

### What is Protocol 2 (OFIA - Block-Free)?

**For patients and families:**

Protocol 2 is an anesthesia approach designed to minimize opioid use while providing excellent pain control for your knee replacement surgery. Here's what to expect:

**Before Surgery:**
- You'll receive oral pain medications (acetaminophen and an anti-inflammatory)
- Your surgeon will inject numbing medicine around your knee (periarticular infiltration)

**During Surgery:**
- You'll be completely asleep and won't feel anything
- We use medications for sleep and pain control that are NOT opioids
- The periarticular infiltration will numb your knee during and after surgery

**After Surgery:**
- Your knee should be comfortable, but you may experience mild to moderate pain (NRS 2–5)
- You'll receive regular non-opioid pain medications (pills and IV)
- If you need additional pain relief, we have other options available
- Most patients can sit up and walk with assistance within a few hours after surgery

**Benefits:**
- Excellent pain control without heavy opioid use
- Less nausea and drowsiness
- Faster recovery and earlier walking
- Shorter hospital stay

**Questions?**
Ask your anesthesiologist or surgeon for more information.

## Appendix C: Institutional Implementation Checklist

**For institutions considering adoption of Protocol 2:**

### Pre-Implementation Requirements

**Personnel:**
- [ ] Attending anesthesiologists trained and credentialed in periarticular infiltration techniques
- [ ] Residents/CRNAs trained in multimodal opioid-sparing anesthesia
- [ ] PACU nurses educated on OFIA pathways and ketamine rescue
- [ ] PT staff aware of POD 0 mobilization goals

**Equipment:**
- [ ] Quantitative TOF monitors available
- [ ] Infusion pumps for dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine (if used)
- [ ] 20% lipid emulsion immediately available in OR and PACU (for LAST management related to surgeon infiltration and/or IV lidocaine)
- [ ] Code cart with full ACLS medications
- [ ] Standard airway management equipment

**Pharmacy:**
- [ ] Ropivacaine 0.2% available in appropriate volumes for infiltration
- [ ] Dexmedetomidine vials/premix available
- [ ] Ketamine vials available (if institutional protocol includes)
- [ ] Lidocaine infusion available (optional)
- [ ] Magnesium sulfate available
- [ ] Sugammadex available in OR and PACU

**Protocols and Policies:**
- [ ] LAST treatment protocol posted in block area, OR, PACU
- [ ] Institutional anticoagulation timing tables aligned with ASRA/ESRA
- [ ] PACU pain management protocols include ketamine rescue (if allowed)
- [ ] Multimodal analgesia order sets created
- [ ] ERAS pathway integration completed

**Quality Metrics:**
- [ ] Pain scores tracked (NRS at arrival, 1h, 2h, discharge)
- [ ] Opioid consumption tracked (MME in PACU, first 24h)
- [ ] PONV incidence tracked
- [ ] Time to mobilization tracked
- [ ] Adverse events tracked (LAST, respiratory depression, bradycardia)
- [ ] PACU/hospital length of stay tracked

**Governance:**
- [ ] Anesthesia department leadership approval
- [ ] Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee approval
- [ ] Surgical leadership approval and engagement
- [ ] Nursing leadership (PACU, floor) approval and training
- [ ] Quality/patient safety committee review
- [ ] IRB approval if data collection for research

### Pilot Phase Recommendations

1. **Start small:** 10–20 patients with experienced attending supervision
2. **Collect data:** Pain, opioid use, mobilization, complications, satisfaction
3. **Debrief regularly:** Weekly meetings to discuss cases, challenges, refinements
4. **Iterate:** Adjust doses, rescue strategies based on outcomes
5. **Scale gradually:** Expand to more surgeons, more cases as competency grows
